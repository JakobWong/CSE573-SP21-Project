This 0

to 0
be 0
the 0
best 0
japanese 0
restaurant 0
in 0
the 0
new 0

. 0
I 0
have 0
been 0
going 0
back 0
again 0
and 0
again 0
. 0
I 0
tend 0
to 0
judge 0
a 0
sushi 0
restaurant 0
by 0
its 0
sea 1
urchin 1
, 0
which 0
was 0
heavenly 0
at 0
sushi 0
rose 0
. 0
It 0
melted 0
in 0
my 0
little 0
mouth 0
and 0
the 0
perfect 0
consistencynot 0
too 0
fishy 0
, 0
creamy 0
, 0
and 0
slightly 0
buttery 0
. 0
The 0
sushi 1
seemed 0
pretty 0
fresh 0
and 0
was 0
adequately 0
proportioned 0
. 0
We 0
took 0
advanatage 0
of 0
the 0
half 1
price 1
sushi 1
deal 1
on 0
saturday 0
so 0
it 0
was 0
well 0
worth 0
it 0
. 0
I 0
went 0
to 0
this 0
restaurant 0
with 0
a 0
woman 0
that 0
I 0
met 0
recently 0
. 0
She 0
lives 0
nearby 0
but 0
had 0
never 0
gone 0
to 0
this 0
establishment 0
thinking 0
that 0
it 0
might 0
be 0
too 0
touristy 0
. 0
Surprisingly 0
nothing 0
could 0
be 0
further 0
from 0
the 0
truth 0
. 0
In 0
the 0
evening 0
, 0
this 0
place 0
attracted 0
a 0
well 0
dressed 0
, 0
with 0
it 0
, 0
NY 0
crowd 1
. 0
The 0
food 1
was 0
well 0
prepared 0
and 0
the 0
service 1
impecable 0
. 0
I 0
'm 0
going 0
back 0
. 0
Having 0
hunted 0
around 0
for 0
a 0
quiet 0
, 0
romantic 0
, 0
yet 0
not 0
hideously 0
expensive 0
restaurant 0
I 0
stumbled 0
across 0
reviews 0
for 0
La 0
Lanterna 0
and 0
gave 0
it 0
a 0
shot 0
. 0
Quite 0
simply 0
it 0
's 0
like 0
stepping 0
out 0
of 0
Manhattan 0
and 0
into 0
a 0
haven 0
of 0
tranquility 0
. 0
The 0
service 0
was 0
attentive 0
, 0
yet 0
unimposing 0
, 0
the 0
food 0
was 0
far 0
better 0
than 0
many 0
notorious 0
restaurants 0
in 0
Midtown 0
and 0
the 0
wine 0
list 0
is 0
extensive 0
and 0
well 0
priced 0
. 0
The 0
Prix 1
Fixe 1
menu 1
is 0
worth 0
every 0
penny 0
and 0
you 0
get 0
more 0
than 0
enough 0
both 0
in 0
quantity 0
AND 0
quality 0
. 0
I 0
will 0
be 0
going 0
back 0
and 0
heartily 0
recommend 0
it 0
! 0
It 0
is 0
terrific 0
, 0
as 0
is 0
the 0
value 0
. 0
$ 0
6 0
and 0
there 0
is 0
much 0
tasty 0
food 1
, 0
all 0
of 0
it 0
fresh 0
and 0
continually 0
refilled 0
. 0
I 0
am 0
not 0
a 0
vegetarian 0
but 0
, 0
almost 0
all 0
the 0
dishes 1
were 0
great 0
. 0
Frankly 0
, 0
when 0
you 0
compare 0
what 0
you 0
can 0
have 0
here 0
for 0
lunch 0
, 0
versus 0
McDs 0
or 0
so 0
many 0
other 0
sandwich 0
shops 0
in 0
the 0
city 0
, 0
there 0
is 0
no 0
comparison 0
. 0
Go 0
hungry 0
and 0
enjoy 0
. 0
The 0
food 1
here 0
is 0
rather 0
good 0
, 0
but 0
only 0
if 0
you 0
like 0
to 0
wait 0
for 0
it 0
. 0
I 0
like 0
the 0
somosas 1
, 0
chai 1
, 0
and 0
the 0
chole 1
, 0
but 0
the 0
dhosas 3
and 0
dhal 3
were 0
kinda 0
dissapointing 0
. 0
The 0
service 3
varys 0
from 0
day 0
to 0
day 0
sometimes 0
they 0
're 0
very 0
nice 0
, 0
and 0
sometimes 0
not 0
. 0
The 0
kitchen 3
however 0
, 0
is 0
almost 0
always 0
slow 0
. 0
Also 0
, 0
specify 0
if 0
you 0
like 0
your 0
food 3
spicy 0
its 0
rather 0
bland 0
if 0
you 0
do 0
n't 0
. 0
The 0
ambience 1
is 0
pretty 0
and 0
nice 0
for 0
conversation 0
, 0
so 0
a 0
casual 0
lunch 0
here 0
would 0
probably 0
be 0
best 0
. 0
Just 0
went 0
here 0
for 0
my 0
girlfriends 0
23rd 0
bday 0
. 0
If 0
you 0
've 0
ever 0
been 0
along 0
the 0
river 0
in 0
Weehawken 0
you 0
have 0
an 0
idea 0
of 0
the 0
top 0
of 0
view 1
the 0
chart 0
house 0
has 0
to 0
offer 0
. 0
Add 0
to 0
that 0
great 0
service 1
and 0
great 0
food 1
at 0
a 0
reasonable 0
price 0
and 0
you 0
have 0
yourself 0
the 0
beginning 0
of 0
a 0
great 0
evening 0
. 0
The 0
lava 1
cake 1
dessert 1
was 0
incredible 0
and 0
I 0
recommend 0
it 0
. 0
Once 0
you 0
step 0
into 0
Cosette 1
, 0
you 0
're 0
miraculously 0
in 0
a 0
small 0
, 0
offthebeaten 0
path 0
Parisian 0
bistro 0
. 0
This 0
tiny 0
restaurant 1
is 0
as 0
cozy 0
as 0
it 0
gets 0
, 0
with 0
that 0
certain 0
Parisian 0
flair 0
. 0
The 0
food 1
was 0
average 0
to 0
aboveaverage 0
; 0
the 0
French 3
Onion 3
soup 3
filling 0
yet 0
not 0
overly 0
impressive 0
, 0
and 0
the 0
desserts 3
not 0
brilliant 0
in 0
any 0
way 0
. 0
However 0
, 0
go 0
for 0
the 0
ambience 1
, 0
and 0
consider 0
the 0
food 2
just 0
a 0
companion 0
for 0
a 0
trip 0
across 0
the 0
world 0
! 0
I 0
have 0
never 0
eaten 0
in 0
the 0
restaurant 0
, 0
however 0
, 0
upon 0
reading 0
the 0
reviews 0
I 0
got 0
take 0
out 0
last 0
week 0
. 0
IT 0
WAS 0
HORRIBLE 0
. 0
The 0
pizza 3
was 0
delivered 0
cold 0
and 0
the 0
cheese 3
was 0
n't 0
even 0
fully 0
melted 0
! 0
I 0
have 0
eaten 0
at 0
many 0
pizza 0
places 0
around 0
NYC 0
and 0
this 0
is 0
hands 0
down 0
the 0
worst 0
. 0
This 0
has 0
got 0
to 0
be 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
most 0
overrated 0
restaurants 0
in 0
Brooklyn 0
. 0
The 0
pizza 3
is 0
overpriced 0
and 0
soggy 0
. 0
Yes 0
, 0
they 0
use 0
fancy 0
ingredients 1
, 0
but 0
even 0
fancy 0
ingredients 1
do 0
n't 0
make 0
for 0
good 0
pizza 3
unless 0
someone 0
knows 0
how 0
to 0
get 0
the 0
crust 3
right 0
. 0
A 0
big 0
disappointment 0
, 0
all 0
around 0
. 0
I 0
think 0
I 0
've 0
had 0
some 0
the 0
best 0
meals 1
of 0
my 0
life 0
at 0
minnow 0

there 0

list 1

and 0
the 0
everchanging 0
menu 1

some 0
great 0
surprises 0

The 0
combination 0
of 0
superfresh 0
ingredients 1
in 0
the 0
dishes 0
are 0
unusual 0

really 0
delicious 0

far 0
my 0
favorite 0

The 0
service 1
is 0
excellent 0

the 0
decor 1
is 0
great 0
, 0
and 0
the 0
food 1
is 0
delicious 0
and 0
comes 0
in 0
large 0
portions 1
. 0
You 0
'll 0
pay 0
at 0
least 0
double 0
at 0
any 0
other 0
Italian 0
restaurant 0
in 0
the 0
city 0
, 0
and 0
most 0
still 0
do 0
n't 0
compare 0
. 0
I 0
'm 0
partial 0
to 0
the 0
Gnocchi 1
. 0
This 0
place 3
is 0
incredibly 0
tiny 0
. 0
The 0
hostess 3
is 0
rude 0
to 0
the 0
point 0
of 0
being 0
offensive 0
. 0
The 0
food 3
was 0
bland 0
oily 0
. 0
I 0
just 0
do 0
n't 0
understand 0
all 0
the 0
hype 0
. 0
We 0
went 0
to 0
Ino 0
for 0
Valentines 0
. 0
We 0
have 0
been 0
to 0
this 0
place 0
many 0
times 0
, 0
and 0
always 0
have 0
great 0
food 1
, 0
wine 1
, 0
and 0
service 1
. 0
We 0
were 0
worried 0
we 0
would 0
have 0
trouble 0
getting 0
in 0
, 0
but 0
somehow 0
managed 0
to 0
have 0
a 0
short 0
wait 1
. 0
When 0
we 0
sat 0
, 0
we 0
got 0
great 0
and 0
fast 0
service 1
. 0
The 0
people 1
that 0
work 0
there 0
are 0
always 0
so 0
friendly 0
you 0
forget 0
you 0
are 0
in 0
New 0
York 0
sometimes 0
. 0
Make 0
sure 0
you 0
try 0
this 0
place 1
as 0
often 0
as 0
you 0
can 0
. 0
This 0
is 0
a 0
fun 0
restaurant 1
to 0
go 0
to 0
. 0
The 0
pizza 1
is 0
yummy 0
and 0
I 0
like 0
the 0
atmoshpere 1
. 0
But 0
the 0
pizza 3
is 0
way 0
to 0
expensive 0
. 0
A 0
large 0
is 0
$ 0
20 0
, 0
and 0
toppings 3
are 0
about 0
$ 0
3 0
each 0
. 0
I 0
went 0
there 0
for 0
lunch 3
and 0
it 0
was 0
not 0
as 0
good 0
as 0
I 0
expected 0
from 0
the 0
reviews 0
I 0
read 0
. 0
Sauce 3
was 0
watery 0
and 0
the 0
food 3
did 0
n't 0
have 0
much 0
flavor 0
. 0
If 0
you 0
like 0
the 0
food 0
and 0
the 0
value 0
you 0
get 0
from 0
some 0
of 0
Chinatown 0
restaurants 0
, 0
this 0
is 0
not 0
the 0
place 0
for 0
you 0
. 0
I 0
do 0
n't 0
think 0
I 0
would 0
go 0
again 0
. 0
I 0
had 0
a 0
huge 0
group 0
for 0
my 0
birthday 0

fantastic 0
service 1
. 0
There 0
was 0
a 0
small 0

shorter 0
than 0
I 0
expected 0

Located 0
at 0
the 0

of 0
a 0
magnificent 0
block 1
. 0
Very 0
cozy 0
and 0
warm 0
inside 0

I 0

The 0
one 0
on 0
the 0

much 0
better 0
than 0
the 0
one 0
on 0
the 0
west 0

. 0
Planet 1
Thailand 1
has 0
always 0
been 0
a 0
hit 0
with 0
me 0
, 0
I 0
go 0
there 0
usually 0
for 0
the 0
sushi 1

on 0
the 0

I 0
eat 0
here 0
often 0
and 0
never 0
get 0
bored 0
. 0
The 0
atmosphere 2
is 0
n't 0
the 0
greatest 0
, 0
but 0
I 0
suppose 0
that 0
's 0
how 0
they 0
keep 0
the 0
prices 0
down 0
. 0
It 0
's 0
all 0
about 0
the 0
food 1
! 0
! 0
I 0
went 0
there 0
with 0
my 0
friend 0
last 0
saturday 0
. 0
first 0
it 0
took 0
us 0
a 0
long 0
time 0
to 0
find 0
the 0
place 3
. 0
we 0
were 0
tired 0
and 0
cold 0
when 0
we 0
got 0
to 0
the 0
restaurant 0
, 0
then 0
we 0
sat 0
down 0
to 0
begin 0
ordering 0
appetizers 0
. 0
but 0
when 0
we 0
looked 0
at 0
the 0
menu 3
, 0
there 0
were 0
n't 0
a 0
lot 0
of 0
choices 0
, 0
most 0
of 0
them 0
were 0
dumplings 0
in 0
the 0
appetizer 0
section 0
. 0
then 0
we 0
ordered 0
a 0
dinosaur 0
rolls 0
and 0
white 0
tuna 0
sashimi 0
. 0
those 0
rolls 2
were 0
big 0
, 0
but 0
not 0
good 0
and 0
sashimi 3
was 0
n't 0
fresh 0
. 0
they 0
were 0
dry 0
and 0
disgusting 0
, 0
i 0
did 0
n't 0
even 0
finish 0
my 0
first 0
piece 0
. 0
Hurley 0
's 0
is 0
like 0
Cheers 0
where 0
everyone 0
knows 0
your 0
name 0
and 0
they 0
are 0
ACTUALLY 0
glad 0
you 0
came 0
. 0
Try 0
the 0
crunchy 1
tuna 1
, 0
it 0
is 0
to 0
die 0
for 0
. 0
Try 0
everything 0
for 0
that 0
matter 0
, 0
it 0
is 0
all 0
good 0
. 0
First 0
went 0
here 0
to 0
enjoy 0
their 0
garden 1
terrace 1
. 0
The 0
food 1
was 0
amazing 0
, 0
and 0
the 0
service 1
was 0
prompt 0
and 0
helpful 0
, 0
but 0
not 0
overbearing 0
or 0
rushed 0
. 0
The 0
Steak 1

is 0
a 0
great 0
bet 0
, 0
they 0
fix 0
it 0
for 0
you 0
at 0
the 0
table 0
. 0
Admittedly 0
some 0
nights 0
inside 0
the 0
restaurant 3
were 0
rather 0
warm 0
, 0
but 0
the 0
open 1
kitchen 1
is 0
part 0
of 0
the 0
charm 0
. 0
Great 0
wine 1
selection 1
, 0
Gigondas 1
is 0
worth 0
the 0
price 0
, 0
and 0
the 0
house 1
champagne 1
is 0
a 0
great 0
value 0
. 0
It 0
may 0
be 0
a 0
bit 0
packed 0
on 0
weekends 0
, 0
but 0
the 0
vibe 1
is 0
good 0
and 0
it 0
is 0
the 0
best 0
French 1

found 0
quite 0
the 0
gem 0
BUT 0
, 0
we 0
were 0
certainly 0
wrong 0
. 0
The 0
waitress 3
moved 0
our 0
table 0
practically 0
into 0
the 0
bathroom 0
and 0
when 0
we 0
asked 0
to 0
cancel 0
our 0
dinner 0

because 0
we 0
did 0
not 0
want 0
to 0
eat 0
sitting 0
on 0
the 0
toilet 0
, 0
we 0
were 0
told 0

she 0
dropped 0
used 0
silverware 0

my 0
boyfriend 0

jacket 0
and 0
did 0
not 0
stop 0
to 0
apologize 0
or 0
clean 0
the 0
mess 0
that 0
was 0
left 0
on 0
clothes 0

by 0
50 0

nice 0
to 0

some 0
mozzarella 0

Also 0
, 0

cold 0
very 0
quickly 0
and 0
its 0
not 0

upstate 0
for 0
a 0
while 0
I 0
would 0
buy 0

the 0
bagels 1
and 0
they 0
would 0
still 0
be 0
better 0
than 0
any 0
else 0
. 0
Worth 0
visiting 0
the 0
1st 1
Ave 1
spot 1
because 0
it 0
is 0
the 0
original 0
store 0
. 0

I 0
asked 0
the 0
chef 0

he 0
recommends 0
and 0
he 0
asked 0
me 0
if 0
I 0
like 0

which 0
happens 0
to 0
be 0
my 0

Aside 0
from 0
the 0

The 0

The 0
restaurant 2
is 0
cute 0
but 0
not 0
upscale 0
. 0
I 0
would 0
highly 0
recommend 0

bit 0
by 0
this 0
little 0
gem 0
. 0
The 0
bagel 1
was 0
huge 0
. 0
The 0
workers 0
there 0
also 0
absolutely 0
load 0
the 0
bagel 3
with 0
cream 0
cheese 0
gets 0
a 0
little 0
messy 0
. 0
I 0
loved 0
it 0
and 0
would 0
HIGHLY 0
RECOMMEND 0

This 0
was 0
my 0
frist 0
time 0
at 0

I 0
must 0
say 0
how 0
delicous 0
the 0
food 1
and 0
the 0
service 1
was 0
. 0
When 0
I 0
called 0
this 0
morning 0

I 0
did 0
n't 0
think 0
I 0
would 0
be 0
able 0
to 0
get 0
in 0
at 0
12 0
, 0
but 0
I 0

the 0
waiters 0
do 0
n't 0
have 0
enough 0
knowledge 0
of 0
their 0
dishes 0
. 0
But 0

do 0
. 0
If 0
you 0
want 0
to 0
dine 0
with 0
large 0

I 0
recommend 0
to 0
make 0

BASEMENT 0
. 0
There 0
's 0
nice 0

This 0
restaurant 3
was 0
way 0
overhyped 0
. 0
My 0

really 0
bland 0

oily 0
part 0
cause 0

it 0
was 0

too 0
bland 0

The 0
scallion 2

nothing 0
out 0
of 0
the 0

The 0
service 1
was 0
the 0
only 0
thing 0
good 0
about 0
this 0
restaurant 3
. 0
It 0
's 0
boring 0
on 0
the 0

and 0
our 0
sushi 3
was 0
pretty 0
below 0
average 0
the 0

was 0
soggy 0
and 0
the 0

had 0
no 0
flavor. 0

definitely 0
would 0

Unbelievable 0

day 0
it 0
was 0
fabulous 0
to 0

lunch 0
. 0
Ambience 1
is 0
so 0
cute 0
and 0
quaint 0
, 0
good 0
for 0
business 0
although 0
we 0
were 0
there 0
on 0

Although 0
we 0
were 0
looking 0
for 0
regular 0
lettuce 0
and 0
some 0
walnuts 0
the 0
salads 1
we 0
got 0
were 0
great 0
. 0
Ingredients 1
are 0
organic 0
which 0
is 0
a 0
real 0
plus 0
for 0
me 0

be 0
back 0

This 0
is 0
some 0
really 0
good 0
, 0
inexpensive 0
sushi 1

It 0
costs 0
$ 0
2 0
extra 0
to 0
turn 0
a 0
regular 0
roll 0
into 0
an 0
insideout 0
roll 0
, 0
but 0
the 0
roll 0
more 0
than 0
triples 0
in 0
size 0
, 0
and 0
that 0
's 0
not 0
just 0
from 0
the 0
rice 0
. 0
The 0
spicy 1
Tuna 1
roll 1
is 0
huge 0
and 0
probably 0
the 0
best 0
that 0
I 0
've 0
had 0
at 0
this 0
price 0
range 0
. 0
The 0
Yellowtail 1
was 0
particularly 0
good 0
as 0
well 0
. 0
In 0
any 0
event 0
, 0
this 0
is 0
a 0
place 1

'll 0
be 0
sure 0
to 0

absolutely 0
delicious 0

the 0
place 1
is 0
lovely 0

even 0
had 0
a 0
visit 0
from 0
the 0
Manager 1
who 0
wanted 0
to 0
make 0
sure 0
we 0
were 0
enjoying 0
ourselves 0
. 0
Yes 0
, 0
the 0
prices 0
are 0
high 0
, 0
but 0
I 0
felt 0
it 0
was 0
worth 0
it 0
. 0
We 0
all 0
felt 0
it 0
was 0
worth 0
it 0
. 0
sometimes 0

good 1

not 0
consistent 0

really 0
depends 0
on 0
your 0
luck 0

The 0
place 0
is 0
a 0
BISTRO 0

means 0
: 0
simple 0

served 0
efficiently 0
in 0
a 0

got 0
the 0
mushroom 1

tasted 0
better 0
. 0
The 0
sangria 1
was 0
pretty 0
tasty 0
and 0
good 0
on 0
a 0
hot 0
muggy 0
day 0
. 0
Kind 0
of 0
a 0
small 0
place 2
but 0
I 0
guess 0
if 0
they 0
are 0
not 0
too 0
busy 0
might 0
be 0
able 0
to 0
fit 0
a 0
group 0
or 0
kids 0
. 0
Overall 0
I 0
would 0
recommend 0
it 0
and 0
go 0
back 0
again 0

also 0
horrible 0

DO 0
not 0
try 0
unless 0
you 0
're 0
just 0
going 0
there 0
to 0
hang 0
out 0
like 0
the 0

of 0
the 0

apparently 0
have 0
no 0
sense 0

I 0
go 0
and 0
eat 0
out 0
at 0
many 0
different 0
restaurants 0

this 0

one 0
place 1

have 0
go 0

. 0
This 0
is 0
my 0
first 0
time 0
writing 0
a 0
review 0
for 0
a 0
restaurant 0
because 0
the 0
food 1
and 0
service 1
was 0
excellent 0
. 0
The 0
filet 1
mignon 1
dish 1
was 0
superb 0
! 0
I 0
would 0
defiantly 0
come 0
back 0
here 0
again 0
as 0
one 0
of 0
my 0
top 0
choices 0
. 0
It 0
's 0
a 0
small 0
cute 0
restaurant 1
. 0
From 0
the 0
street 0
it 0
looks 0
very 0
hidden 0
, 0
and 0
is 0
actually 0
an 0
old 0
warehouse 0
. 0
I 0
like 0
the 0
ambience 1
, 0
it 0
's 0
very 0
dark 0
and 0
original 0
. 0
I 0
came 0
here 0
for 0
my 0
friend 0
's 0
birthday 0
and 0
keep 0
coming 0
back 0
ever 0
since 0

amazingly 0
cheap 0
. 0
Big 0
thumbs 0

some 0
beef 3
and 3
noodle 3

dishes 3
from 0
the 0
Thai 0
section 0

the 0

were 0
very 0

Next 0

My 0

cover 0
the 0

although 0
it 0

it 0
was 0
not 0
nearly 0
enough 0
to 0
warrant 0
that 0
price 0
. 0
Went 0
to 0
Village 0
last 0
night 0
for 0
my 0
birthday 0
. 0
We 0
picked 0
it 0
randomly 0
, 0
without 0
a 0
recommendation 0
from 0
someone 0
who 0
has 0
been 0
there 0
, 0
so 0
we 0
were 0
n't 0
sure 0
what 0
to 0
expect 0
. 0
The 0
food 1
was 0
delicious 0
I 0
had 0
a 0
halibut 1
special 1
, 0
my 0
husband 0
had 0
steak 1
, 0
and 0
the 0
service 1
was 0
topnotch 0
. 0
Truly 0
the 0
mark 0
of 0
an 0
attentive 0
waiter 1
. 0
I 0
highly 0
recommend 0
the 0
restaurant 1
based 0
on 0
our 0
experience 0
last 0
night 0
. 0
We 0
ate 0
at 0
this 0
Thai 0
place 0
following 0
the 0
reviews 0
but 0
very 0
unhappy 0
with 0
the 0
foods 3

We 0
thought 0
that 0
this 0
place 0
is 0
using 0
too 0
much 0
of 0
MSG 0
cooking 0
in 0
the 0
foods 3
. 0
Why 0
? 0
They 0
do 0
n't 0
concern 0
much 0
of 0
customer 0
's 0
health 0
, 0
just 0
want 0
to 0
make 0
money 0

n't 0
fool 0
us 0

I 0
visit 0

Bo 0
when 0
I 0
have 0
money 0

when 0
I 0
am 0
broke 0

I 0
recommend 0
the 0
jelly 1
fish 1
, 0
drunken 1
chicken 1
and 0
the 0
soupy 1
dumplings 1
, 0
certainly 0
the 0
stir 1

The 0
service 3
was 0
terrible 0
, 0
we 0
had 0
to 0
wait 0
for 0
everything 0
and 0
ask 0
several 0
of 0
different 0
people 0
for 0
the 0
same 0
thing 0
before 0
we 0
were 0
allowed 0
to 0
be 0
served 0
. 0
The 0
waitress 3
, 0
seems 0
to 0
be 0
more 0
concerned 0
of 0
looking 0
good 0
than 0
actually 0
waitressing 3

The 0
whole 0
set 0
up 0

truly 0
unprofessional 0
and 0
I 0
wish 0
Cafe 1

would 0
get 0
some 0
good 0
staff 3
, 0
because 0
despite 0
the 0
current 0
one 0
this 0
is 0
a 0
great 0
place 0
. 0
Salads 1
are 0
a 0
delicious 0
way 0
to 0
begin 0
the 0

the 0

and 0
the 0

of 0
the 0

minutes 0
, 0
but 0
I 0
guess 0
that 0
's 0
the 0
price 0
you 0
pay 0
for 0
a 0
popular 0
place 0
. 0
I 0
would 0
definitely 0
recommend 0
SEA 0
if 0
you 0
like 0
thai 1
cuisine 1
! 0
I 0
was 0
here 0
a 0
few 0
weeks 0
back 0
and 0
we 0
had 0
the 0
worst 0
customer 3
service 3
experience 0
at 0
a 0
restaurant 0
ever 0
. 0
While 0
it 0
is 0
understandable 0
that 0
every 0
place 0
is 0
indeed 0
different 0
, 0
there 0
was 0
not 0
a 0
need 0
to 0
be 0
uncourteous 0
to 0
customers 0
and 0
downright 0
rude 0
. 0
The 0
service 0
was 0
poor 0
, 0
restaurant 0
poorly 0
lit 0
, 0
staff 0
not 0
very 0
attentive 0
and 0
I 0
would 0
have 0
rather 0
eaten 0
at 0
a 0
Mcdonald 0
's 0
than 0
this 0
joint 0
. 0
Never 0
again 0
! 0
I 0
absolutely 0
Loved 0
this 0
place 1
. 0
My 0
friends 0
spoke 0
so 0
much 0
about 0
it 0
for 0
months 0
, 0
I 0
finally 0
made 0
the 0
time 0
to 0
come 0
down 0
ear 0
and 0
dine 0
in 0
. 0
Excellent 0
atmosphere 1

think 0
that 0

If 0

The 0

has 0
been 0
nice 0
, 0
but 0
they 0
seemed 0
really 0
stressed 0
and 0
the 0
unisex 3

needs 0

be 0
cleaned 0
more 0

My 0

and 0
I 0
went 0
there 0
to 0
celebrate 0
my 0

the 0
other 0
night 0
and 0
all 0
I 0
can 0
say 0
is 0
that 0
it 0
was 0
magnificent 0
. 0
From 0
the 0
spectacular 0
caviar 1
to 0
the 0
hospitable 0
waitstaff 1
, 0
I 0
felt 0
like 0
royalty 0
and 0
enjoyed 0
every 0
second 0
of 0
it 0
. 0
Considering 0
we 0
were 0
the 0
last 0
patrons 0
there 0
and 0
it 0
was 0
after 0
the 0
closing 0
time 0
, 0
the 0
waitstaff 1
did 0
not 0
rush 0
us 0
at 0
all 0

made 0
us 0
feel 0

outstanding 0
, 0
particulary 0
the 0
salmon 1

I 0
had 0

good. 0
. 0
We 0
ate 0
out 0
in 0
the 0
back 1
patio 1
, 0
which 0
is 0
worth 0
it 0
as 0
it 0
's 0
cool 0
and 0
the 0
music 1
is 0
hear 0
well 0
there 0
. 0
Overall 0
, 0
excellent 0
restaurant 1
! 0
i 0
went 0
to 0
utsav 0
about 0
a 0
yr 0
ago 0
with 0
my 0
family 0
. 0
The 0
food 1
was 0
good 0
. 0
The 0
place 1
was 0
nice 0
and 0
calm 0
. 0
but 0
the 0
service 3
was 0
a 0
bit 0
slow 0
. 0
I 0
work 0
around 0
the 0
corner 0
and 0
tried 0
it 0
with 0
a 0
colleague 0
for 0
the 0
first 0
time 0
. 0
The 0
buffet 1
had 0
a 0
nice 0
selection 0
. 0
Service 1
was 0
also 0
very 0
good 0
. 0
I 0
would 0
go 0
back 0
. 0
I 0
got 0
an 0
excellent 0
piece 0
of 0
cheesecake 1
and 0
we 0
had 0
several 0
other 0
nice 0
pastries 1
. 0
My 0
son 0
and 0
his 0
girlfriend 0
both 0
wanted 0
cheeseburgers 2
and 0
they 0
were 0
huge 0
! 0
But 0
, 0
they 0
were 0
too 0
big 0
for 0
the 0
bun 0
. 0
Consequently 0
, 0
their 0
burgers 3
fell 0
apart 0
in 0
their 0
hands 0
and 0
made 0
such 0
a 0
mess 0
that 0
they 0
did'nt 0
feel 0
like 0
finishing 0
them 0
. 0
Also 0
they 0
were 0
$ 0
15 0
each 0
! 0
I 0
had 0
a 0
huge 0
pastrami 2
sandwich 2
on 2
a 2
roll 2
. 0
It 0
was 0
$ 0
14 0
not 0
really 0
bad 0
for 0
a 0
pound 0
of 0
Pastramibut 0
it 0
did 0
n't 0
have 0
much 0
tasteI 0
've 0
had 0
better 0
for 0
less 0
elsewhere 0
! 0
This 0
place 1
is 0
really 0
trendi 0
but 0
they 0
have 0
forgotten 0
about 0
the 0
most 0
important 0
part 0
of 0
a 0
restaurant 0
, 0
the 0
food 3
. 0
The 0
last 0
two 0
times 0
I 0
ordered 0
from 0
here 0
my 0
food 3
was 0
soo 0
spicy 0
that 0
I 0
could 0
barely 0
eat 0
it 0
, 0
and 0
the 0
spice 3
took 0
away 0
from 0
the 0
flavor 0
of 0
the 0
dish 0
. 0
If 0
you 0
want 0
good 0
authentic 0
Thai 3
this 0
place 0
is 0
not 0
the 0
place 0
to 0

. 0
We 0
went 0
here 0
for 0
lunch 0
a 0
couple 0
of 0
weeks 0

By 0
far 0
, 0
the 0
best 0

many 0
fish 0
items 0

oysters 0

We 0
all 0
ordered 0

up 0
on 0

I 0
stumbled 0
upon 0
this 0
great 0
pizzeria 1
as 0
I 0
explored 0
my 0
new 0
neighborhood 0
. 0
All 0
of 0
the 0
pizzas 1
are 0
terrific 0
and 0
the 0
price 0
is 0
even 0
better 0
! 0
I 0
highly 0
recommend 0
the 0
Sophia 1

. 0
It 0
's 0
to 0
die 0
for 0
! 0
The 0
food 3
was 0
mediocre 0
at 0
best 0
but 0
it 0
was 0
the 0
horrible 0
service 3
that 0
made 0
me 0
vow 0
never 0
to 0
go 0
back 0
. 0
Immediately 0
after 0
we 0
paid 0
, 0
the 0
waiter 3
took 0
the 0
money 0

. 0
As 0

were 0
leaving 0

the 0

to 0
another 0

're 0
