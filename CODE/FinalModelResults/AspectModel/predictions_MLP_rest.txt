weekend 0

She 0
had 0
heard 0
from 0

about 0
this 0
place 0
. 0
The 0
food 1
was 0
great 0
! 0
It 0
's 0
very 0
reasonably 0
priced 0
, 0
esp 0
for 0
the 0
quality 0
of 0
the 0
food 1
. 0
I 0
had 0
the 0
Kafta 1
plate 1
and 0
it 0
was 0
perfect 0
. 0
We 0
're 0
going 0
back 0

: 0
D 0
Finally 0
a 0
meal 0
that 0
you 0
will 0
remember 0
for 0
a 0
long 0
time 0
! 0
This 0
is 0
the 0
place 1
to 0
relax 0
and 0
enjoy 0
the 0
finest 0
quality 0
food 1
the 0
industry 0
can 0
offer 0
. 0
Some 0
of 0
the 0
food 1
is 0
clearly 0
oriented 0
toward 0
foodies 1
like 0
me 0
so 0
if 0
your 0
not 0
a 0
foodie 1
nothing 0
wrong 0
with 0
that 0
head 0
over 0
to 0
McDonalds 0
or 0
some 0
Ruby 0
Tuesday 0
and 0
have 0
at 0
it 0
! 0
Very 0
Disappointing 0
– 0
I 0
took 0
my 0
parents 0
here 0
for 0
their 0
anniversaryvery 0
very 0
disappointed 0
!! 0
! 0
I 0
liked 0
the 0
atmosphere 1
very 0
much 0
but 0
the 0
food 1
was 0
not 0
worth 0
the 0
price 0
. 0
I 0
may 0
not 0
be 0
a 0
sushi 1
guru 1
but 0
I 0
can 0
tell 0
you 0
that 0
the 0
food 1
here 0
is 0
just 0
okay 0
and 0
that 0
there 0
is 0
not 0
much 0
else 0
to 0
it 0
. 0
Rice 1
is 0
too 0
dry 0
, 0
tuna 1
was 0
n't 0
so 0
fresh 0
either 0
. 0
Nothing 0
really 0
came 0
across 0
as 0
outstanding 0
. 0
Very 0
disappointed 0
. 0
I 0
have 0
eaten 0
here 0
three 0
times 0
and 0
have 0
found 0
the 0
quality 0
and 0
variety 0
of 0
the 0
fish 1
to 0
be 0
excellent 0
. 0
However 0
, 0
the 0
value 0
and 0
service 1
are 0
both 0
severely 0
lacking 0
. 0
Portions 1
contain 0
less 0
fish 1
than 0
one 0
would 0
expect 0
, 0
particularly 0
since 0
prices 0
are 0
in 0
line 0
with 0
the 0
best 0
sushi 1
places 0
in 0
NYC 0
Masa 0
excluded 0
, 0
of 0
course 0
. 0
Furthermore 0
, 0
while 0
the 0
fish 1
is 0
unquestionably 0
fresh 0
, 0
rolls 1
tend 0
to 0
be 0
inexplicably 0
bland 0
. 0
The 0
service 1
ranges 0
from 0
mediocre 0
to 0
offensive 0
. 0
On 0
a 0
recent 0
trip 0
, 0
our 0
waiter 1
was 0
extremely 0
dismissive 0
, 0
while 0
no 0
less 0
than 0
three 0
staff 1
members 0
waited 0
handandfoot 0
on 0
a 0
pair 0
of 0
Japanese 0
girls 0
seated 0
nearby 0
. 0
We 0
were 0
then 0
charged 0
for 0
their 0
most 0
expensive 0
sake 0
$ 0
20 0
per 0
serving 0
when 0
we 0
in 0
fact 0
drank 0
a 0
sake 0
of 0
less 0
than 0
half 0
that 0
price 0
. 0
But 0
Im 0
sure 0
this 0
was 0
just 0
an 0
honest 0
mistake 0
. 0
Freshest 0
sushi 1
– 0
I 0
love 0
this 0
restaurant 0
. 0
They 0
pay 0
such 0
detail 0
to 0
everything 0
from 0
miso 0
soup 1
to 0
complex 0
rolls 1
. 0
The 0
sashimi 1
was 0
the 0
freshest 0
and 0
most 0
tender 0
I 0
have 0
ever 0
tasted 0
. 0
Their 0
apps 1
are 0
all 0
delicious 0
. 0
The 0
only 0
drawback 0
is 0
that 0
this 0
place 1
is 0
really 0
expensive 0
and 0
the 0
portions 0
are 0
on 0
the 0
small 0
side 0
. 0
But 0
the 0
space 1
is 0
small 0
and 0
lovely 0
, 0
and 0
the 0
service 1
is 0
helpful 0
. 0
You 0
are 0
bound 0
to 0
have 0
a 0
very 0
charming 0
time 0

great 0
service 1
my 0
service 1
was 0
stellar 0
! 0
the 0
bus 0
boy 0
even 0
spotted 0
that 0
my 0
table 0
was 0
shaking 0
a 0
stabilized 0
it 0
for 0
me 0
. 0
food 1
was 0
fine 0
, 0
with 0
a 0
some 0

If 0
you 0
're 0
in 0
the 0
area 0
you 0
should 0
n't 0
be 0
disappointed 0
. 0
the 0
food 1
was 0
great 0
, 0
the 0
margaritas 1
too 0

the 0
waitress 1
was 0
too 0
busy 0
being 0
nice 0
to 0
her 0
other 0
larger 0
party 0
than 0
to 0
take 0
better 0
care 0
of 0
my 0
friend 0
and 0
me 0
. 0
Took 0
forever 0
to 0
get 0
our 0
order 0
taken 0
, 0
water 1
refills 0
were 0
too 0
much 0
to 0
ask 0
for 0
and 0
the 0
only 0
time 0
she 0
was 0
fast 0
was 0
when 0
we 0
asked 0
for 0
our 0
bill 0
when 0
we 0
could 0
get 0
her 0
attention 0

lucky 0
to 0
live 0
by 0
such 0
a 0
great 0
pizza 0

the 0
only 0
problem 0
is 0
you 0
really 0
have 0
to 0
warm 0
up 0
the 0
pizza 1
before 0
it 0
's 0
edible 0

when 0

have 0
a 0

even 0
list 0
which 0
oceans 0

My 0
only 0
negative 0
comment 0
is 0
that 0
I 0
wish 0
the 0

The 0

The 0
crowd 1
is 0
mixed 0
yuppies 0

. 0
The 0
service 1
was 0
courteous 0
and 0
attentive 0

Mediocre 0
food 1
The 0
outside 1

has 0
an 0
abbreviated 0

We 0
ordered 0
the 0
marinated 0

buffalo 1

chicken 1
wings 0

and 0
the 0
turkey 1
sandwich 1
. 0
We 0
are 0
locals 0

and 0
get 0
the 0
feeling 0
the 0
only 0
way 0
this 0
place 0
survives 0
with 0
such 0
average 0
food 1
is 0
because 0
most 0
customers 0

onetime 0

Excellent 0
food 1
, 0
nice 0
ambience 1

fairly 0

The 0
ambiance 1
was 0
a 0
peaceful 0
and 0
relaxing 0
break 0
amongst 0
all 0
the 0
kids 0
running 0
around 0
in 0
Downtown 0
Disney 0
. 0
I 0
recommend 0
it 0
for 0
a 0
night 0
when 0
you 0
want 0
to 0
splurge 0
! 0
it 0
was 0
a 0
bit 0
expensive 0
Best 0
Indian 1
food 1
in 0
L.A 0
. 0
The 0
best 0
thing 0
is 0
, 0
the 0
prices 0
are 0
also 0
quite 0
reasonable 0
. 0
The 0
chicken 1
curry 1
and 0
chicken 1
tikka 1
masala 1
are 0
my 0
favorite 0
meat 1
dishes 1
. 0
The 0
chana 1
masala 1
garbanzo 1
beans 1
are 0
also 0
excellent 0
. 0
It 0
's 0
located 0
in 0
a 0
strip 0
mall 0
near 0
the 0
Beverly 0
Center 0
, 0
not 0
the 0
greatest 0
location 0
, 0
but 0
the 0
food 1
keeps 0
me 0
coming 0
back 0
for 0
more 0
. 0
hidden 0
little 0
jem 1
Never 0
too 0
crowded 0
and 0
always 0
great 0
service 1
. 0
I 0
think 0
I 0
have 0
probably 0
tried 0
each 0
item 0
on 0
their 0
menu 0
at 0
least 0
once 0
it 0
is 0
all 0
excellent 0
. 0
I 0
can 0
highly 0
recommend 0
their 0
various 0
saag 1
and 0
paneer 1
and 0
korma 1
. 0
You 0
routinely 0
see 0
Indian 0
families 0
and 0
friends 0
dining 0
there 0
, 0
which 0
is 0
always 0
a 0
good 0
sign 0
. 0
I 0
appreciate 0
their 0
delivery 0
too 0
. 0
Nice 0
food 1
but 0
no 0
spice 1

, 0
samosas 0
, 0
naan 0
, 0

The 0
food 1
was 0
all 0
good 0
but 0
it 0
was 0
way 0
too 0
mild 0
. 0
Normally 0
, 0
places 0
ask 0
how 0
hot 0
you 0
want 0
it 0
, 0
but 0
they 0
did 0
n't 0
. 0
I 0
should 0
have 0
thought 0
to 0
bring 0
it 0
up 0
but 0
never 0
expected 0
the 0
food 1
to 0
be 0
that 0
mild 0
. 0
I 0
will 0
give 0
them 0
another 0
chance 0
and 0
make 0
sure 0
to 0
tell 0
them 0
to 0
kick 0
it 0
up 0
several 0
notches 0

just 0

My 0

The 0

THE 0
best 0
hummus 0
in 0
America 0
, 0
with 0
a 0
drizzle 1
of 0
fragrant 0
olive 1
oil 1
which 0
, 0
I 0
believe 0
is 0
the 0
traditional 0
way 0
! 0
The 0
only 0
drawback 0
is 0
the 0
crowded 0
seating 1
and 0
the 0
slow 0
service 1
. 0
There 0
have 0
been 0
several 0
occasions 0
when 0
we 0
've 0
just 0
not 0
gotten 0
some 0
side 0

we 0
've 0
ordered 0

However 0
, 0
this 0

is 0
a 0
gem 0

and 0
I 0
wo 0
n't 0
stop 0
going 0
back 0

great 0
beer 1
I 0
swore 0
never 0
to 0
return 0
for 0
a 0
warm 0
beer 0
and 0
mediocre 0
meal 0
. 0
HOWEVER 0
, 0
one 0
Sunday 0
afternoon 0
my 0
husband 0
and 0
I 0
did 0
go 0
although 0
with 0
my 0
loud 0
protests 0
and 0
were 0
pleasantly 0
surprised 0
. 0
The 0
band 1
was 0
very 0
good 0
and 0
the 0
service 1
was 0
attentive 0
. 0
Outside 0
in 0
the 0
area 0
between 0
the 0
restaurant 0
and 0
the 0
park 0
, 0
children 0
were 0
running 0
around 0
while 0
their 0
parents 0
sipped 0
wine 0

We 0
ordered 0
a 0
selection 0
of 0
the 0
small 0

the 0

grilled 0
asparagus 1
and 0
fried 0
brie 1
with 0
fruit 0
were 0
all 0
very 0
good 0
. 0
It 0
was 0
like 0
dining 0
at 0
a 0
completely 0
different 0
restaurant 0
. 0
We 0
have 0
since 0
returned 0
and 0
also 0
had 0
a 0
great 0
experience 0
, 0
sampling 0
more 0
small 0
plates 0
and 0
a 0
variety 0
of 0
the 0
beer 1
cold 0
and 0
good 0
. 0
We 0
did 0
have 0
the 0
same 0
waiter 1
the 0
second 0
time 0
, 0
so 0
maybe 0
the 0
service 1
is 0
spotty 0
and 0
our 0
luck 0
is 0
good 0
. 0
Sunday 0
afternoons 0
there 0
is 0
a 0

when 0

came 0
over 0

a 0
link 0
for 0
a 0
give 0
away 0

does 0
n't 0
work 0

I 0
never 0
heard 0

said 0

try 0
again 0
but 0
we 0
will 0
visit 0
the 0
lower 0

. 0
After 0
sitting 0

for 0
over 0
20 0
minutes 0
the 0
bar 0
keep 0
had 0

traps 1
and 0
making 0
the 0

making 0
it 0
even 0

. 0
best 0
chinese 1
food 1
i 0
have 0
tasted 0
in 0
a 0
long 0
time 0
there 0
was 0
a 0
guy 0
playing 0
the 0
piano 1
and 0
singing 0
at 0
the 0
bar 0
area 0
which 0
was 0
separate 0
from 0
the 0
dinning 0
area 0
. 0
You 0
can 0
easily 0
hear 0
him 0
though 0
so 0
it 0
was 0
a 0
pleasant 0
sound 0
and 0
not 0
overbearing 0
. 0
the 0
ambiance 1
of 0
the 0
restaurant 0
was 0
nice 0
and 0
good 0
for 0
fine 0
dinning 0
. 0
not 0
too 0
fine 0
thought 0
that 0
you 0
feel 0
uncomfortable 0
and 0
have 0
to 0
dress 0
up 0
. 0
the 0
staff 1
was 0
very 0
nice 0
and 0
courteous 0
and 0
obviously 0
chinese 0
. 0
we 0
ordered 0
the 0
honey 1
walnut 1
prawns 0
which 0
we 0
always 0
order 0
at 0
every 0
chinese 0
restaurant 0
to 0
determine 0
the 0
quality 0
of 0
food 1
. 0
First 0
off 0
, 0
the 0
food 1
came 0
fast 0
and 0
all 0
together 0
: 0
i 0
like 0
that 0
i 0
hate 0
the 0
pretentiousness 0
of 0
things 0
coming 0
in 0
one 0
after 0
the 0
other. 0
. 0
so 0
about 0
the 0
prawns 1
, 0
they 0
were 0
fresh 0
and 0
had 0
a 0
slight 0
crispiness 0
about 0
the 0
batter 0
soooo 0
good 0
the 0
walnuts 1
were 0
cut 0
in 0
smaller 0
pieces 0
and 0
very 0
crunchy 0
and 0
tasty. 0
. 0
yummy 0
. 0
best 0
honey 0
walnyt 0
prawns 0
that 0
we 0
have 0
every 0
tasted 0
. 0
next 0
one 0
that 0
we 0
ordered 0
were 0
prawns 0
and 0
scallop 0
with 0
brocolli 0
. 0
the 0
brocollis 1
were 0
so 0
fresh 0
and 0
tasty 0
. 0
i 0
would 0
normally 0
not 0
finish 0
the 0
brocolli 1
when 0
i 0
order 0
these 0
kinds 0
of 0
food 1
but 0
for 0
the 0
first 0
time 0
, 0
every 0
piece 0
was 0
as 0
eventful 0
as 0
the 0
first 0
one 0
the 0
scallops 1
and 0
prawns 1
was 0
so 0
fresh 0
and 0
nicely 0
cooked. 0
. 0
not 0
chewy 0
at 0
all 0
. 0
melt 0
in 0
your 0
mouth 0
. 0
we 0
are 0
for 0
sure 0
coming 0
back 0
to 0
this 0
restaurant 0
. 0
every 0
month 0
if 0
possible 0
. 0
Chintzy 0
portions 1
We 0
easily 0
spent 0
more 0
than 0
$ 0
40 0
per 0
person 0
not 0
including 0
alcohol 0
and 0
were 0
still 0
hungry 0
. 0
Terrible 0
service 1
, 0
food 1
ok 0
, 0
pricey 0
So 0
for 0
the 0
after 0
beach 0
excursion 0
' 0
, 0
we 0
thought 0
we 0
would 0
end 0
the 0
day 0
on 0
a 0
high 0
note 0
and 0
make 0
the 0
trip 0
across 0
the 0
street 0
from 0
the 0
beach 0
to 0
Park 0
Chalet 1
. 0
The 0
restaurant 1
was 0
busy 0
, 0
however 0
there 0
were 0
a 0
few 0
tables 0
open 0
. 0
We 0
put 0
out 0
name 0
down 0
and 0
although 0
there 0
were 0
open 0
tables 0
we 0
were 0
told 0
that 0
it 0
'd 0
be 0
a 0
30 0
minute 0
wait 0
. 0
So 0
here 0
we 0
are 0
, 0
my 0
wife 0
, 0
3 0
year 0
old 0
daughter 0
and 0
I 0
trying 0
to 0
pass 0
the 0
time 0
by 0
hanging 0
out 0
in 0
the 0
front 0
of 0
the 0
building 0
where 0
the 0
murals 0
and 0
artifacts 0
are 0
. 0
30 0
minutes 0
went 0
by 0
and 0
sure 0
enough 0
the 0
pager 1
buzzer 1
went 0
off 0
. 0
We 0
went 0
back 0
to 0
the 0
restaurant 0
and 0
low 0
and 0
behold 0
, 0
we 0
were 0
seated 0
at 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
tables 0
that 0
was 0
available 0
30 0
minutes 0
ago 0
! 0
! 0
Logic 0
behind 0
that 0
? 0
None 0
that 0
I 0
can 0
think 0
of 0
. 0
We 0
put 0
in 0
our 0
order 0
and 0
although 0
we 0
ordered 0
4 0
appetizers 1
, 0
the 0

did 0
n't 0
arrive 0
until 0
45 0

Oh 0
I 0
forgot 0
to 0
mention 0
that 0
they 0
do 0
n't 0
have 0
bread 0
service 1
. 0
Its 0
a 0
good 0
thing 0
my 0
daughter 0
had 0
some 0
snacks 0
in 0
her 0
lunch 0
bag 0
. 0
My 0
wife 0
also 0
ordered 0
a 0
teapot 0
of 0
hot 0
water 1
she 0
had 0
a 0
sore 0
throat 0
and 0
I 0
guess 0
that 0
since 0
it 0
was 0
only 0
water 0
, 0
it 0
was 0
n't 0
a 0
priority 0
for 0
them 0
to 0
actually 0
bring 0
it 0
. 0
Food 0
wise 0
, 0
its 0
ok 0
but 0
a 0
bit 0
pricey 0
for 0
what 0
you 0
get 0
considering 0
the 0
restaurant 0
is 0
n't 0
a 0
fancy 0
place 0
. 0
The 0
upside 0
of 0
the 0
restaurant 0
? 0
If 0
I 0
needed 0
to 0
name 0
some 0
they 0
would 0
include 0
the 0
location 0
to 0
the 0
beach 0
or 0
Golden 0
Gate 1
park 0
. 0
Its 0
great 0
if 0
you 0
spent 0
the 0
day 0
there 0
and 0
did 0
n't 0
want 0
to 0
drive 0
to 0
eat 0
. 0
Parking 0
is 0
reasonably 0
good 0
, 0
they 0
have 0
their 0
own 0
lot 0
and 0
you 0
can 0
park 0
in 0
the 0
park 0
nearby 0
. 0
Another 0
plus 0
is 0
the 0
open 0
feel 0
of 0
the 0
restaurant 0
with 0
glass 0
walls 0
on 0
all 0
sides 0
. 0
I 0
'd 0
hate 0
for 0
tourists 0
to 0
go 0
to 0
Park 0
Chalet 0
and 0
think 0
that 0
this 0
is 0
how 0
all 0
San 0
Francisco 0
restaurants 0
are 0
like 0
. 0
Always 0
good 0
. 0
6pm 0
on 0
a 0
Sat 0
before 0
a 0
Broadway 0
play 0
and 0
we 0
were 0
quickly 0
seated 0
and 0
served 0
. 0
As 0
usual 0
the 0
omikase 1
did 0
n't 0
disappoint 0
in 0
freshness 0
, 0
although 0
it 0
scored 0
low 0
on 0
creativity 0
and 0
selection 0
. 0
Their 0
specialty 1
rolls 1
are 0
impressive 0
, 0
though 0
I 0
ca 0
n't 0
remember 0
what 0
we 0
had 0
. 0
Great 0
selection 1
of 0
sakes 1
. 0
Green 0
tea 1
creme 1
brulee 1
gets 0
better 0
each 0
time 0
I 0
have 0
it 0
. 0
It 0
is 0
n't 0
the 0
cheapest 0
sushi 1
but 0
has 0
been 0
worth 0
it 0
every 0
time 0
. 0
Very 0
poor 0
customer 1
service 1
. 0
While 0
this 0
diner 0
had 0
reasonably 0
good 0
food 1
, 0
the 0
restaurant 1
staff 1
seemed 0
completely 0
indifferent 0
to 0
our 0
presence 0
, 0
and 0
this 0
attitude 0
was 0
reflected 0
in 0
the 0
lack 0
of 0
service 1
. 0
As 0
part 0
of 0
a 0
small 0
party 0
of 0
four 0
, 0
our 0
food 1
was 0
dropped 0
off 0
without 0
comment 0
; 0
any 0
further 0
needs 0
we 0
may 0
have 0
had 0
could 0
not 0
have 0
been 0
met 0
since 0
no 0
one 0
stopped 0
by 0
the 0
table 0
. 0
When 0
we 0
finally 0
were 0
able 0
to 0
flag 0
someone 0
down 0
, 0
it 0
was 0
someone 0
entirely 0
different 0
from 0
the 0
person 0
who 0
had 0
dropped 0
off 0
the 0
food 1
, 0
who 0
was 0
also 0
not 0
the 0
same 0
person 0
who 0
had 0
taken 0
our 0
order 0
. 0
After 0
one 0
member 0
of 0
our 0
party 0
had 0
been 0
bumped 0
repeatedly 0
by 0
a 0
waitress 0
, 0
a 0
polite 0
request 0
that 0
he 0
not 0
be 0
bumped 0
sent 0
the 0
waitress 0
into 0
an 0
abusive 0
rant 0
. 0
The 0
manager 0
continually 0
interrupted 0
with 0
Is 0
there 0
anything 0
else 0
I 0
can 0
do 0
for 0
you 0
? 0
, 0
a 0
strange 0
comment 0
because 0
she 0
had 0
hardly 0
listened 0
, 0
let 0
alone 0
responded 0
to 0
our 0
expression 0
of 0
disappointment 0
at 0
our 0
experience 0
. 0
She 0
promised 0
to 0
speak 0
to 0
the 0
waitress 1
who 0
had 0
flown 0
off 0
in 0
a 0
rage 0
, 0
but 0
we 0
could 0
hardly 0
take 0
her 0
promise 0
seriously 0
, 0
seeing 0
as 0
she 0
had 0
n't 0
bothered 0
to 0
get 0
the 0
waitresses 1
name 0
. 0
In 0
short 0
, 0
Schooner 0
or 0
Later 0
could 0
n't 0
have 0
cared 0
less 0
about 0
our 0
being 0
at 0
their 0
establishment 0
. 0
Next 0
time 0
we 0
will 0
go 0
somewhere 0
else 0
, 0
or 0
try 0
other 0
restaurants 0
