I 0
charge 0
it 0
at 0
night 0
and 0
skip 0
taking 0

because 0
of 0
the 0
good 0
battery 1
life 1

I 0
bought 0
a 0
HP 0

service 3
center 3

not 0
do 0
1to1 0
exchange 0
and 0
I 0
have 0
to 0

my 0
concern 0
to 0
the 0
sales 3
team 3
, 0
which 0
is 0
the 0
retail 0
shop 0
which 0
I 0
bought 0
my 0
netbook 0
from 0
. 0
I 0
investigated 0
netbooks 0
and 0
saw 0
the 0
Toshiba 0
NB305N410BL 0
. 0
it 0
is 0
of 0
high 0
quality 1
, 0
has 0
a 0
killer 0
GUI 1
, 0
is 0
extremely 0
stable 0
, 0
is 0
highly 0
expandable 0
, 0
is 0
bundled 0
with 0
lots 0
of 0
very 0
good 0
applications 1
, 0
is 0
easy 0
to 0
use 1
, 0
and 0
is 0
absolutely 0
gorgeous 0
. 0
Easy 0
to 0
start 1
up 1
and 0
does 0
not 0
overheat 0
as 0
much 0
as 0
other 0
laptops 0
. 0
Sad 0
very 0
SAD 0
. 0
I 0
even 0
got 0
my 0
teenage 0
son 0
one 0
, 0
because 0
of 0
the 0
features 1
that 0
it 0
offers 0
, 0
like 0
, 0
iChat 1
, 0
Photobooth 1
, 0
garage 1
band 1
and 0
more 0
! 0
Needless 0
to 0
say 0
a 0
PC 0
that 0
ca 0
n't 0
support 0
a 0
cell 0
phone 0
is 0
less 0
than 0
useless 0
! 0
Great 0
laptop 0
that 0
offers 0
many 0
great 0
features 1
! 0
they 0
have 0
done 0
absolutely 0
nothing 0
to 0
fix 0
the 0
computer 0
problem 0
. 0
One 0
night 0
I 0
turned 0
the 0
freaking 0
thing 0
off 0
after 0
using 0
it 0
, 0
the 0
next 0
day 0
I 0
turn 0
it 0
on 0
, 0
no 0
GUI 3
, 0
screen 3
all 0
dark 0
, 0
power 2
light 2
steady 0
, 0
hard 3
drive 3
light 3
steady 0
and 0
not 0
flashing 0
as 0
it 0
usually 0
does 0
. 0
Still 0
pretty 0
pricey 0
, 0
but 0
I 0
've 0
been 0
putting 0
off 0
money 0
for 0
a 0
while 0
as 0
a 0
little 0
Macbook 0
Fund 0
, 0
and 0
finally 0
got 0
to 0
use 0
it 0
. 0
In 0
the 0
shop 0
, 0
these 0
MacBooks 0
are 0
encased 0
in 0
a 0
soft 0
rubber 1
enclosure 1
so 0
you 0
will 0
never 0
know 0
about 0
the 0
razor 0
edge 3
until 0
you 0
buy 0
it 0
, 0
get 0
it 0
home 0
, 0
break 0
the 0
seal 0
and 0
use 0
it 0
very 0
clever 0
con 0
. 0
However 0
, 0
the 0
multitouch 1
gestures 1
and 0
large 0
tracking 1
area 1
make 0
having 0
an 0
external 2
mouse 2
unnecessary 0
unless 0
you 0
're 0
gaming 2
. 0
Plus 0
it 0
is 0
small 0
and 0
reasonably 0
light 0
so 0
I 0
can 0
take 0
it 0
with 0
me 0
to 0
and 0
from 0
work 0
. 0
I 0
HATE 0
this 0
one 0
. 0
They 0
were 0
totally 0
unconcerned 0
that 0
the 0
computer 0
was 0
not 0
correctly 0
repaired 0
in 0
the 0
first 0
place 0
. 0
The 0
speed 1
is 0
incredible 0
and 0
I 0
am 0
more 0
than 0
satisfied 0
. 0
on 0
the 0
bright 0
side 0
at 0
least 0
I 0
was 0
n't 0
without 0
my 0
laptop 0
for 0
long 0
this 0
time 0
! 0
This 0
laptop 0
meets 0
every 0
expectation 0
and 0
Windows 1
7 1
is 0
great 0
! 0
That 0
's 0
how 0
frustrating 0
it 0
was 0
. 0
I 0
can 0
barely 0
use 0
any 0
usb 3
devices 3
because 0
they 0
will 0
not 0
stay 0
connected 0
properly 0
. 0
The 0
one 0
down 0
side 0
to 0
it 0
is 0
that 0
when 0
I 0
play 0
a 0
certin 0
game 0
on 0
here 0
, 0
it 0
tends 0
to 0
freeze 0
up 0
sometimes 0
, 0
but 0
thats 0
the 0
only 0
bad 0
thing 0
about 0
this 0
computer 0
. 0
No 0
backlit 0
keyboard 0
, 0
but 0
not 0
an 0
issue 0
for 0
me 0
. 0
When 0
I 0
finally 0
had 0
everything 0
running 0
with 0
all 0
my 0
software 2
installed 0
I 0
plugged 0
in 0
my 0
droid 0
to 0
recharge 0
and 0
the 0
system 3
crashed 0
. 0
I 0
ca 0
n't 0
even 0
turn 0
it 0
off 0
. 0
One 0
suggestion 0
I 0
do 0
have 0
, 0
is 0
to 0
not 0
bother 0
getting 0
Microsoft 3
office 3
for 3
the 3
mac 3
expecting 0
it 0
will 0
work 0
just 0
like 0
you 0
knew 0
it 0
to 0
on 0
a 0
PC 0
. 0
I 0
also 0
got 0
the 0
added 0
bonus 0
of 0
a 0
30 1
HD 1
Monitor 1
, 0
which 0
really 0
helps 0
to 0
extend 0
my 0
screen 2
and 0
keep 0
my 0
eyes 0
fresh 0
! 0
Would 0
do 0
business 0
again 0
. 0
The 0
machine 0
is 0
slow 0
to 0
boot 3
up 3
and 0
occasionally 0
crashes 0
completely 0
. 0
After 0
paying 0
several 0
hundred 0
dollars 0
for 0
this 0
service 3
, 0
it 0
is 0
frustrating 0
that 0
you 0
can 0
not 0
get 0
help 0
after 0
hours 0
. 0
I 0
have 0
had 0
the 0
luxury 0
sarcasm 0
of 0
owning 0
2 0
of 0
these 0
laptops 0
. 0
What 0
a 0
waste 0
. 0
It 0
was 0
a 0
total 0
Dhell 0
experience 0
that 0
I 0
will 0
never 0
repeat 0
. 0
There 0
are 0
a 0
few 0
flaws 0
as 0
well 0
that 0
I 0
noticed 0
. 0
Completely 0
worth 0
every 0
single 0
penny 0
dime 0
and 0
nickel 0
. 0
I 0
tried 0
to 0
upgrade 0
it 0
to 0
a 0
newer 0
version 0
a 0
couple 0
of 0
months 0
ago 0
and 0
I 0
still 0
have 0
the 0
same 0
problem 0
. 0
I 0
did 0
have 0
to 0
replace 0
the 0
battery 0
once 0
, 0
but 0
that 0
was 0
only 0
a 0
couple 0
months 0
ago 0
and 0
it 0
's 0
been 0
working 0
perfect 0
ever 0
since 0
. 0
: 0
In 0
the 0
past 0
four 0
years 0
I 0
've 0
had 0
it 0
I 0
have 0
never 0
once 0
gotten 0
a 0
virus 0
. 0
I 0
love 0
the 0
operating 1
system 1
and 0
the 0
preloaded 1
software 1
. 0
They 0
were 0
great 0
in 0
handling 0
this 0
problem 0
, 0
and 0
I 0
'm 0
looking 0
forward 0
in 0
purchasing 0
additonal 0
products 0
from 0
them 0
in 0
the 0
future 0
. 0
I 0
've 0
tried 0
going 0
back 0
to 0
XL 0
but 0
there 0
still 0
problems 0
. 0
The 0
best 0
thing 0
about 0
this 0
laptop 0
is 0
the 0
price 1
along 0
with 0
some 0
of 0
the 0
newer 0
features 1
. 0
After 0
numerous 0
attempts 0
of 0
trying 0
including 0
setting 0
the 0
clock 3
in 3
BIOS 3

it 0
may 0
be 0
potentially 0
hundreds 0
or 0
thousands 0
in 0
the 0
near 0
future 0
. 0
but 0
now 0
i 0
have 0
realized 0
its 0
a 0
problem 0
with 0
this 0
brand 3
. 0
It 0
can 0
not 0
save 0
the 0
correct 0

And 0
this 0
is 0
n't 0
just 0
my 0
one 0
experine 0
. 0
I 0
was 0
looking 0
for 0
a 0

thats 0
why 0
I 0
am 0
a 0
self 0
proclaimed 0
mac 0
addict 0
. 0
And 0
these 0
are 0
some 0
reasons 0
you 0
should 0
get 0
a 0
macbook 0
pro 0
. 0
Also 0
kinda 0
loud 0
when 0
the 0
fan 3
was 0
running 0
. 0
I 0
purchased 0
this 0
laptop 0
while 0
on 0
a 0
business 0
trip 0
to 0
keep 0
up 0
with 0
my 0
email 0

There 0
also 0
seemed 0
to 0
be 0
a 0
problem 0
with 0
the 0
hard 3
disc 3
as 0
certain 0
times 0
windows 3
loads 0
but 0
claims 0

I 0
think 0
just 0

gotten 0
me 0
totally 0
spoiled 0
and 0
I 0
ca 0

was 0
happy 0
with 0
My 0
purchase 0
of 0
a 0
Toshiba 0
Satellite 0
L305DS5934 0
laptop 0
until 0
it 0

time 0
to 0
have 0
it 0
repaired 0
under 0
the 0
Toshiba 3
Warranty 3
. 0
I 0
LOVE 0
IT 0
! 0
The 0
fact 0
that 0
you 0
can 0
spend 0
over 0
$ 0
100 0
on 0
just 0
a 0
webcam 2
underscores 0
the 0
value 1
of 0
this 0
machine 0
. 0
I 0
mainly 0
use 0
it 0
for 0
email 0
, 0
internet 2
, 0
and 0
managing 2
personal 2
files 2
pics 0
, 0
vids 0
, 0
etc. 0
. 0
A 0
month 0
or 0
so 0
ago 0
, 0
the 0
freaking 0
motherboard 3
just 0
died 0
. 0
The 0
system 3
it 0
comes 0
with 0
does 0
not 0
work 0
properly 0
, 0
so 0
when 0
trying 0
to 0
fix 0
the 0
problems 0
with 0
it 0
it 0
started 0
not 0
working 0
at 0
all 0
. 0
Then 0
after 0
4 0
or 0
so 0
months 0
the 0
charger 3
stopped 0
working 0
so 0
I 0
was 0
forced 0
to 0
go 0
out 0
and 0
buy 0
new 0
hardware 3
just 0
to 0
keep 0
this 0
computer 0
running 0
. 0
I 0
took 0
it 0
back 0
to 0
Best 0
Buy 0
where 0
they 0
were 0
so 0
helpful 0
and 0
immediately 0
gave 0
me 0
a 0
new 0
one 0
. 0
If 0
you 0
had 0
PC 0
for 0
four 0
years 0
I 0
can 0
almost 0
gaurentee 0
that 0
something 0
would 0
of 0
gone 0
wrong 0
by 0
now 0
, 0
maybe 0
even 0
forcing 0
you 0
to 0
replace 0
your 0
entire 0
computer 0
. 0
2 0
weeks 0
after 0
giving 0
the 0
computer 0
for 0
repairCalled 0
headquarters 0
, 0
they 0
report 0
that 0
they 0
have 0
not 0
looked 0
at 0
it 0
yet 0
but 0
it 0
is 0
on 0
the 0
top 0
of 0
the 0
stack 0
. 0
This 0
machine 0
delivers 0
. 0
Then 0
2 0
of 0
my 0
nephews 0
were 0
going 0
into 0
music 0
and 0
both 0
fell 0
in 0
love 0
with 0
the 0
MacBook 0
Pro 0
. 0
I 0
complain 0
again 0
. 0
This 0
laptop 0
is 0
insane 0
! 0
! 0
! 0
If 0
a 0
website 0
ever 0
freezes 0
which 0
is 0
rare 0
, 0
its 0
really 0
easy 0
to 0
force 1
quit 1
. 0
It 0
rarely 0
works 3
and 0
when 0
it 0
does 0
it 0
's 0
incredibly 0
slow 0
. 0
I 0
also 0
enjoy 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
my 0
MacBook 0
Pro 0
laptop 0
allows 0
me 0
to 0
run 0
Windows 1
7 1
on 0
it 0
by 0
using 0
the 0
VMWare 2
program 2
. 0
It 0
's 0
so 0
much 0
easier 0
to 0
navigate 1
through 0
the 0
operating 1
system 1
, 0
to 0
find 1
files 1
, 0
and 0
it 0
runs 1
a 0
lot 0
faster 0
! 0
Purchased 0
a 0
Toshiba 0
Lap 0
top 0
it 0
worked 0
good 0
until 0
just 0
after 0
the 0
warrenty 3
went 0
out 0
. 0
I 0
always 0
swore 0
by 0
PCs 0
and 0
would 0
never 0
consider 0
a 0
MAC 0
. 0
This 0
is 0
now 0
my 0
3rd 0
MacBook 0
Pro 0
and 0
I 0
really 0
honestly 0
love 0
it 0
! 0
for 0
2 0
months 0
. 0
I 0
wanted 0
to 0
purchase 0
the 0
extended 2
warranty 2
and 0
they 0
refused 0
, 0
because 0
they 0
knew 0
it 0
was 0
trouble 0
. 0
It 0
's 0
not 0
like 0
I 0
have 0
used 0
for 0
half 0
a 0
year 0
and 0
then 0
complained 0
about 0
it 0
. 0
Still 0
trying 0
to 0
learn 0
how 0
to 0
use 0
it 0
. 0
The 0
reality 0
was 0
, 0
it 0
heated 0
up 0
very 0
quickly 0
, 0
and 0
took 0
way 0
too 0
long 0
to 0
do 0
simple 0
things 0
, 0
like 0
opening 3
my 3
Documents 3
folder 3
. 0
I 0
bought 0
the 0
netbook 0
because 0
it 0
was 0
smaller 0
and 0
lighter 0
for 0
me 0
to 0
carry 0
around 0
. 0
We 0
'll 0
save 0
our 0
money 0
to 0
replace 0
it 0
with 0
a 0
Mac 0
again 0
! 0
Thank 0
you 0
for 0
your 0
great 0
product 0
! 0
this 0
company 0
truely 0
does 0
make 0
horrible 0
products 0
and 0
doesnt 0
seem 0
to 0
because 0
they 0
are 0
certain 0
things 0
like 0
this 0
never 0

I 0
had 0
always 0
used 0
PCs 0
and 0
been 0
constantly 0
frustrated 0
by 0
the 0
crashing 0
and 0
the 0
poorly 0
designed 0
operating 3
systems 3
that 0
were 0
never 0
very 0
intuitive 0
. 0
Sorry 0
Toshiba 0
, 0
but 0
1st 0
impressions 0
do 0
count 0
for 0
something 0
. 0
Then 0
, 0
within 0
5 0
months 0
, 0
the 0
charger 3
crapped 0
out 0
on 0
me 0
. 0
And 0
if 0
you 0

a 0

you 0
can 0
connect 0
and 0
download 0

it 0
at 0
high 0
speed 1

Overall 0
this 0
laptop 0
is 0
great 0
. 0
I 0
love 0
the 0
glass 1
touchpad 1
. 0
I 0
continued 0
to 0
take 0
the 0
computer 0
in 0
AGAIN 0
and 0
they 0
replaced 0
the 0
hard 3
drive 3
and 0
mother 3
board 3
yet 0
again 0
. 0
I 0
am 0
using 0
the 0
external 1
speaker 1
sound 1
is 0
good 0
. 0
Ok 0
, 0
this 0
is 0
probably 0
the 0
best 0
laptop 0
series 0
ever 0
devised 0
by 0
Apple 0
. 0
As 0
of 0
a 0
couple 0
weeks 0
ago 0
the 0
middle 0
portion 0
of 0
the 0
laptop 0
from 0
top 0
to 0
bottom 0
, 0
, 0
, 0
about 0
4 0
inches 0
across 0
is 0
hardly 0
visible 0
. 0
still 0
testing 0
the 0
battery 3
life 3
as 0
i 0
thought 0
it 0
would 0
be 0
better 0
, 0
but 0
am 0
very 0
happy 0
with 0
the 0
upgrade 0
. 0
Then 0
HP 0
sends 0
it 0
back 0
to 0
me 0
with 0
the 0
hardware 3
screwed 0
up 0
, 0
not 0
able 0
to 0
connect 0
. 0
I 0
just 0
hope 0
the 0
reputation 0
that 0
Toshiba 0
has 0
is 0
true 0
and 0
I 0
wo 0
n't 0
have 0
to 0
worry 0
about 0
a 0
crash 0
. 0
Oh 0
yeah 0
, 0
do 0
n't 0
forget 0
the 0
expensive 0
shipping 3
to 0

from 0
HP 0

would 0
recommend 0
anyone 0
to 0
buy 0
from 0

Good 0

so 0
easy 0

just 0
so 0
much 0
simpler 0
than 0
Microsoft 3
software 3
. 0
My 0
favorite 0
by 0
far 0
, 0
although 0
the 0
most 0
expensive 0
, 0
was 0
my 0
Sony 0
. 0
And 0
if 0
you 0
do 0
a 0
lot 0
of 0
writing 0
, 0
editing 3
is 0
a 0
problem 0
since 0

no 0
forward 0

key 3
. 0
Also 0
I 0
typed 0
faster 0
then 0
then 0

to 0

realy 0
annoying 0

After 0
about 0
a 0

finally 0
got 0
it 0
back 0
and 0
was 0
told 0
that 0
the 0
motherboard 3
had 0
failed 0
and 0
so 0
they 0
installed 0
a 0
new 0
motherboard 3
. 0
It 0
was 0
slow 0
, 0
locked 0
up 0
, 0
and 0
also 0
had 0
hardware 3
replaced 0
after 0
only 0
2 0
months 0
! 0
they 0
had 0
to 0
replace 0
the 0
motherboard 3
in 0
April 0
Yes 0
, 0
the 0
computer 0
was 0
light 0
weight 0
, 0
less 0
expensive 0
than 0
the 0
average 0
laptop 0
, 0
and 0
was 0
pretty 0
self 0
explantory 0
in 0
use 1
. 0
Also 0
, 0
if 0
you 0
need 0
to 0
talk 0
to 0
a 0
representive 3
at 3
Microsoft 3
, 0
there 0
is 0
a 0
charge 0
, 0
which 0
I 0
believe 0
is 0
robbery 0
, 0
since 0
you 0
are 0
charged 0
enormous 0
amounts 0
for 0
a 0
very 0
badly 0
designed 0
system 3
, 0
which 0
most 0
people 0
would 0
have 0
went 0
with 0
XP 1
if 0
they 0
could 0
. 0
I 0
love 0
WIndows 1
7 1
which 0
is 0
a 0
vast 0
improvment 0
over 0
Vista 3
. 0
Also 0
, 0
I 0
have 0
alot 0
of 0
trouble 0
with 0
it 0
getting 0
very 0
hot 0

and 0
not 0
even 0
sitting 0
on 0
anything 0
to 0
make 0

It 0
Was 0
a 0
great 0

after 0
all 0

This 0
mac 0
is 0
great 0
! 0
Keyboard 1
is 0
great 0
, 0
very 0
quiet 0
for 0
all 0
the 0
typing 0
that 0
I 0
do 0
. 0
I 0
grew 0
up 0
in 0
a 0
design 0
family 0
so 0
it 0
only 0
made 0
sense 0
. 0
Gave 0
phonenumber 0
. 0
Oh 0
my 0
goodnessI 0
am 0
not 0
a 0
happy 0
camper 0
. 0
I 0
'd 0
recommend 0
this 0

to 0
anyone 0
! 0
Yet 0
, 0
HP 0
wo 0
n't 0
do 0
anything 0
about 0
the 0
problem 0
. 0
It 0
had 0
a 0
cooling 3
system 3
malfunction 0
after 0
10 0
minutes 0
of 0
general 0
use 2
, 0
and 0
would 0
not 0
move 0
past 0
this 0
error 0
. 0
I 0
can 0
render 0
AVCHD 0
movies 0
with 0
little 0
effort 0
, 0
which 0
was 0
a 0
problem 0
for 0
most 0
pc 0
's 0
unless 0
you 0
had 0
a 0
quad 1
core 1
I7 1
. 0
It 0
's 0
a 0
bummer 0
and 0
one 0
out 0
of 0
five 0
is 0
being 0
kind 0
. 0
This 0
is 0
what 0
they 0
told 0
me 0
: 0
It 0
heats 0
up 0
, 0
and 0
that 0
is 0
the 0
reason 0
we 0
no 0
longer 0
call 0
them 0
laptops 0
, 0
and 0
simply 0
categorize 0
them 0
as 0
portables 0
. 0
After 0
talking 0
it 0
over 0
with 0
the 0
very 0
knowledgeable 0
sales 1
associate 1
, 0
I 0
chose 0
the 0
MacBook 0
Pro 0
over 0
the 0
white 0
MacBook 0
. 0
If 0
you 0
really 0
want 0
a 0
bangup 0
system 1
and 0
do 0
n't 0
need 0
to 0

You 0

on 0
some 0
inefficient 0
virus 3
program 3
that 0
needs 0
to 0
be 0
updated 0
every 0
month 0
and 0
that 0
constantly 0
drains 0
your 0
wallet 0
. 0
This 0
laptop 0
is 0
fast 0
and 0
you 0
will 0
literally 0
learn 0
all 0
you 0
can 0
do 0
with 0
this 0
dynamo 0
by 0
just 0
watching 0
the 0
online 0
tutorials 0
. 0
One 0
of 0
them 0
seems 0
to 0
have 0
worked 0
. 0
Which 0
I 0
still 0
use 0
and 0
have 0
hooked 0
up 0
to 0
my 0
TV 0

The 0
problem 0
I 0
had 0
with 0
this 0

was 0
unresolvable 0
. 0
2 0
months 0
later 0
, 0
the 0
battery 3
went 0
. 0
You 0
may 0
need 0
to 0
special 0
order 0
a 0
bag 2
. 0
It 0
's 0

even 0
cool 0

Another 0
two 0
weeks 0
later 0
and 0
it 0
was 0
back 0
in 0
my 0
possession 0
. 0
keys 3
are 0
all 0
in 0
weird 0
places 0
and 0
is 0
way 0
too 0
large 0
for 0
the 0
way 0
it 0
is 0
designed 3
. 0
I 0
've 0
owned 0
every 0

for 0
the 0
last 0
8 0
years 0
, 0
this 0
is 0
BY 0
FAR 0
the 0
WORST 0
one 0
I 0
've 0
ever 0
had 0
. 0
We 0
purchase 0
the 0
Dell 0
XPS 0
several 0
years 0
ago 0
for 0
my 0
home 0
business 0

Have 0
purchased 0
many 0

like 0
all 0

others 0
, 0
we 0
smoothly 0
with 0
no 0

I 0
would 0
recommend 0
anyone 0
to 0
buy 0
from 0
pcconnection 0
express 0
. 0
Yes 0
, 0
a 0
Mac 0
is 0
much 0
more 0
money 0
than 0
the 0
average 0
laptop 0
out 0
there 0
, 0
but 0
there 0
is 0
no 0
comparison 0
in 0
style 1
, 0
speed 1
and 0
just 0
cool 0
factor 0
. 0
He 0
gave 0
me 0
this 0
PC 0
about 0
3 0
years 0
ago 0
and 0
up 0
to 0
this 0
point 0
im 0
still 0
sitting 0
here 0
using 0

I 0
'm 0
pleased 0

The 0
keyboard 1
feels 0
good 0
and 0
I 0
type 0
just 0
fine 0
on 0
it 0
. 0
Shiny 0
This 0
Laptop 0
is 0
the 0
Best 0
of 0
the 0
best 0
! 0
I 0
thought 0
the 0
white 0
Mac 0
computers 0
looked 0
dirty 0
too 0
quicly 0
where 0
you 0
use 0
the 0
mousepad 2
and 0
where 0
you 0
place 0
your 0
hands 0
when 0
typing 0
. 0
Do 0
n't 0
waste 0
their 0
money 0
, 0
save 0
it 0
and 0
but 0
a 0
mac 0
. 0
Money 0
and 0
time 0
well 0
spent 0
! 0
Gradually 0
the 0
freezing 0
screen 0
evolved 0
into 0
a 0
screen 0
that 0
froze 0
in 0
weird 0
shapes 0
. 0
Good 0
laptop 0
for 0
the 0
money 0
. 0
I 0
like 0
the 0
laptop 0
overall 0
. 0
I 0
now 0
travel 0
with 0
this 0
laptop 0
and 0
my 0
work 0
PC 0
. 0
I 0
am 0
however 0
pleased 0
that 0
it 0
is 0
still 0
hanging 0
in 0
there 0
. 0
Both 0
my 0
husband 0
and 0
I 0
have 0
this 0
model 0
Toshiba 0
. 0
no 0
complaints 0
with 0
their 0
desktop 0
, 0
and 0
maybe 0
because 0
it 0
just 0
sits 0
on 0
your 0
desktop 0
, 0
and 0
you 0
do 0
n't 0
carry 0
it 0
around 0
, 0
which 0
could 0
jar 0
the 0
hard 2
drive 2
, 0
or 0
the 0
motherboard 2
. 0
Yes 0
, 0
they 0
cost 0
more 0
, 0
but 0
they 0
more 0
than 0
make 0
up 0
for 0
it 0
in 0
speed 1
, 0
construction 1
quality 1
, 0
and 0
longevity 1
. 0
Since 0
I 0
keyboard 1
over 0
100 0
wpm 0

I 0
look 0
for 0
a 0
unit 0
that 0
has 0
a 0
comfortble 0
keyboard 1
no 0
keys 1
sticking 0
or 0
lagging 0
, 0
strange 0
configuration 1
of 1
extra 1
key 1

etc 0
. 0
I 0
also 0
tried 0
the 0
touch 2
pad 2
and 0
compared 0
it 0
to 0
other 0
netbooks 0
in 0
the 0
store 0

It 0
gets 0
stuck 0
all 0
of 0
the 0
time 0
you 0
use 3
it 0

and 0
you 0
have 0
to 0
keep 0
tapping 0
on 0
it 0

get 0
it 0
to 0

having 0
them 0
stop 0
working 0
after 0
a 0
year 0
. 0
I 0
should 0
have 0
been 0
more 0
observant 0
. 0
I 0
wish 0
it 0
had 0
a 0
webcam 3
though 0
, 0
then 0
it 0
would 0
be 0
perfect 0
! 0
My 0
favorite 0
part 0
of 0
this 0
computer 0
is 0
that 0
it 0
has 0
a 0
vga 1
port 1
so 0
I 0
can 0
connect 0
it 0
to 0
a 0
bigger 0
screen 2
. 0
Another 0
thing 0
I 0
might 0
add 0
is 0
the 0
battery 1
life 1
is 0
excellent 0
. 0
One 0
drawback 0
, 0
I 0
wish 0
the 0
keys 3
were 0
backlit 0
. 0
When 0
the 0
buyer 0
returned 0
it 0
Wal 0
Mart 0
just 0
boxed 0
it 0
, 0
taped 0
it 0
shut 0
resold 0
it 0
as 0
new 0
. 0
What 0
a 0
great 0
little 0
laptop 0
. 0
Acer 0
was 0
no 0
help 0
and 0
Garmin 0
could 0
not 0
determine 0
the 0
problemafter 0
spending 0
about 0
2 0
hours 0
with 0
me 0
, 0
so 0
I 0
returned 0
it 0
and 0
purchased 0
a 0
Toshiba 0
R700 0
that 0
seems 0
even 0
nicer 0
and 0
I 0
was 0
able 0
to 0
load 0
all 0
of 0
my 0
software 1
with 0
no 0
problem 0
. 0
I 0
play 0
a 0
lot 0
of 0
casual 0
games 0
online 0
, 0
and 0
the 0
touchpad 1
is 0
very 0
responsive 0
. 0
Granted 0
, 0
it 0
's 0
still 0
a 0
very 0
new 0
laptop 0
but 0
in 0
comparison 0
to 0
my 0
previous 0
laptops 0
and 0
desktops 0
, 0
my 0
Mac 0
boots 1
up 1
noticeably 0
quicker 0
. 0
It 0
caught 0
a 0
virus 0
that 0
completely 0
wiped 0
out 0
my 0
hard 3
drive 3
in 0
a 0
matter 0
of 0
hours 0
. 0
WOULD 0
PAY 0
MORE 0
FOR 0
IT 0
IF 0
I 0
HAD 0
TOO 0
! 0
Could 0
n't 0
keep 0
a 0
page 0
up 0
you 0
were 0
working 0
on 0
! 0
It 0
is 0
everything 0
I 0
'd 0
hoped 0
it 0
would 0
be 0
from 0
a 0
look 1
and 1
feel 1
standpoint 1
, 0
but 0
somehow 0
a 0
bit 0
more 0
sturdy 0
. 0
I 0
would 0
not 0
recommend 0
this 0
product 0
to 0
anyone 0
. 0
I 0
like 0
to 0
use 0
it 0
at 0
the 0
race 0
track 0
to 0
handiecap 0
the 0
horse 0
races 0
. 0
I 0
was 0
given 0
a 0
Mac 0
as 0
a 0
birthday 0
present 0
and 0
could 0
n't 0
be 0
happier 0
with 0
it 0
3 0
years 0
later 0
. 0
The 0
delivery 1
was 0
fast 0
, 0
and 0
I 0
would 0
not 0
hesitate 0
to 0
purchase 0
this 0
laptop 0
again 0
. 0
I 0
've 0
been 0
impressed 0
with 0
the 0
battery 1
life 1
and 0
the 0
performance 1
for 0
such 0
a 0
small 0
amount 0
of 0
memory 3
. 0
do 0
a 0
quick 0
search 0
on 0
the 0
internet 0
see 0
if 0
im 0
the 0
only 0
one 0
. 0
I 0
'm 0
extremely 0
happy 0
with 0
my 0
purchase 0
as 0
I 0
now 0
have 0
the 0
portable 0
power 0
I 0
have 0
been 0
looking 0
for 0
. 0
It 0
's 0
applications 1
are 0
terrific 0
, 0
including 0
the 0
replacements 0
for 0
Microsoft 1
office 1
. 0
I 0
got 0
it 0
back 0
and 0
my 0
builtin 3
webcam 3
and 0
builtin 3
mic 3
were 0
shorting 0
out 0
anytime 0
I 0
touched 0
the 0
lid 0
, 0
mind 0
you 0
this 0
was 0
my 0
means 0
of 0
communication 0
with 0
my 0
fiance 0
who 0
was 0
deployed 0
but 0
I 0
suffered 0
thru 0
it 0
and 0
would 0
constandly 0
have 0
to 0
reset 0
the 0
computer 0
to 0
be 0
able 0
to 0
use 0
my 0
cam 3
and 0
mic 3
anytime 0
they 0
went 0
out 0
. 0
Is 0
this 0
partially 0
due 0
to 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
it 0
is 0
running 0
Windows 2
Vista 2
? 0
You 0
might 0
think 0
, 0
I 0
am 0
new 0
in 0
this 0
game 0
, 0
but 0
I 0
am 0
a 0
gadget 0
lover 0
, 0
and 0
have 0
had 0
more 0
than 0
2 0
dozens 0
laptops 0
in 0
the 0
past 0
15 0
years 0
, 0
and 0
none 0
gets 0
this 0
hot 0
, 0
that 0
fast 0
. 0
I 0
was 0
informed 0
that 0
I 0
need 0
to 0
call 0
some 0
0900 0
number 0
first 0
. 0
I 0
really 0
wanted 0
a 0
Mac 0
over 0
a 0
pc 0
because 0
I 0
used 0
a 0
Mac 0
in 0
high 0
school 0
. 0
1 0
Payed 0
$ 0
2200 0
for 0
a 0
premium 0
laptop 0
I 0
BOUGHT 0
THEM 0
FOR 0
MY 0
COLLEGE 0
AGE 0
GRANDCHILDREN 0
AND 0
THESE 0
MACS 0
ARE 0
TOTALLY 0
RELIABLE 0
AND 0
SUPPORT 0
THEIR 0
CLASS 0
WORK 0
100 0
% 0
OF 0
THE 0
TIME 0
. 0
The 0
board 3
has 0
a 0
bad 0
connector 3
with 0
the 0
power 3
supply 3
and 0
shortly 0
after 0
warrenty 3
expires 0
the 0
power 3
supply 3
will 0
start 0
having 0
issues 0
. 0
Do 0
not 0
purchase 0
this 0
laptop 0
. 0
My 0
dad 0
has 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
very 0
first 0
Toshibas 0
ever 0
made 0
, 0
yes 0
its 0
abit 0
slow 0
now 0
but 0
still 0
works 1
well 0
and 0
i 0
hooked 0
to 0
my 0
ethernet 1
! 0
Mostly 0
I 0
love 0
the 0
drag 1
and 1
drop 1
feature 1
. 0
oh 0
yeah 0
, 0
and 0
if 0
the 0
fancy 0
webcam 3
breaks 0
guess 0
who 0
you 0
have 0
to 0
send 0
it 0
to 0
to 0
get 0
it 0
fixed 0
? 0
She 0
brought 0
out 0
2 0
other 0
identical 0
netbooks 0
and 0
still 0
insist 0
that 0
It 0
is 0
like 0
that 0
one 0
. 0
I 0
ordered 0
through 0
MacMall 0
, 0
which 0
saved 0
me 0
the 0
sales 1
tax 1
I 0
would 0
have 0
incurred 0
buying 0
locally 0
. 0
Very 0
fast 0
and 0
efficient 0
! 0
Of 0
course 0
, 0
I 0
also 0
have 0
several 0
great 0
software 1
packages 1
that 0
came 0
for 0
free 0
including 0
iWork 1
, 0
GarageBand 1
, 0
and 0
iMovie 1
. 0
Being 0
virusresistant 0
is 0
a 0
huge 0
plus 0
. 0
The 0
screen 1
is 0
very 0
large 0
and 0
crystal 0
clear 0
with 0
amazing 0
colors 1
and 0
resolution 1
. 0
After 0
a 0
little 0
more 0
than 0
a 0
year 0
of 0
owning 0
my 0
MacBook 0
Pro 0
, 0
the 0
monitor 3
has 0
completely 0
died 0
. 0
In 0
my 0
house 0
, 0
HP 0
is 0
a 0
nasty 0
word 0
. 0
The 0
brand 0
of 0
iTunes 1
has 0
just 0
become 0
ingrained 0
in 0
our 0
lexicon 0
now 0
, 0
but 0
keep 0
in 0
mind 0
that 0
Apple 0
started 0
it 0
all 0
. 0
By 0
the 0
way 0
teachers 0
, 0
they 0
offer 0
a 0
discount 0
which 0
helps 0
! 0
I 0
still 0
see 0
the 0
benefits 0
of 0
a 0
PC 0
when 0
I 0
do 0
not 0
know 0
how 0
to 0
do 0
something 0
on 0
my 0
mac 0
. 0
Size 3
: 0
I 0
know 0
13 0
is 0
small 0
especially 0
for 0
a 0
desktop 0
replacement 0
but 0
with 0
an 0
external 2
monitor 2
, 0
who 0
cares 0
. 0
It 0
is 0
held 0
in 0
place 0
magnetically 0
. 0
Taking 0
it 0
back 0
to 0
Best 0
Buy 0
I 0
found 0
that 0
a 0
tiny 0
plastic 0
piece 0
inside 0
had 0
broken 0
manuf 3
issue 0
. 0
It 0
has 0
no 0
camera 0
but 0
, 0
I 0
can 0
always 0
buy 0
and 0
install 0
one 0
easy 0
. 0
The 0
display 1
is 0
incredibly 0
bright 0
, 0
much 0
brighter 0
than 0
my 0
PowerBook 0
and 0
very 0
crisp 0
. 0
We 0
were 0
PC 0
users 0
. 0
The 0
AMD 1
Turin 1
processor 1
seems 0
to 0
always 0
perform 0
so 0
much 0
better 0
than 0
Intel 3
. 0
After 0
that 0
the 0
said 0
it 0
was 0
under 0
warranty 2
. 0
The 0
start 3
menu 3
is 0
not 0
the 0
easiest 0
thing 0
to 0
navigate 3
due 0
to 0
the 0
stacking 0
. 0
This 0
computer 0
was 0
awful 0
, 0
I 0
would 0
never 0
recomend 0
it 0
to 0
another 0
person 0
. 0
The 0
service 3
tech 3
said 0
he 0
had 0
tried 0
to 0
duplicate 0
the 0
damage 0
and 0
was 0
n't 0
able 0
to 0
recreate 0
it 0
therefore 0
it 0
had 0
to 0
be 0
their 0
defect 0
. 0
The 0
tech 3
store 3
I 0
purchased 0
this 0
from 0
sent 0
it 0
back 0
, 0
, 0
, 0
, 0
, 0
eventually 0
I 0
got 0
a 0
new 0
or 0
repaired 0
machine 0
approximately 0
3 0
weeks 0
later 0
. 0
I 0
loved 0
it 0
then 0
, 0
but 0
unfortunately 0
it 0
was 0
before 0
the 0
days 0
of 0
wireless 0
internet 0
. 0
Really 0
like 0
the 0
textured 0
surface 1
which 0
shows 0
no 0
fingerprints 0
. 0
I 0
WILL 0
NEVER 0
AGAIN 0
buy 0
another 0
Acer 0
, 0
not 0
will 0
I 0
buy 0
Gateway 0
, 0
or 0
eMachine 0
as 0
they 0
are 0
all 0
from 0
the 0
same 0
company 0
. 0
The 0
screen 1
is 0
bright 0
and 0
the 0
keyboard 1
is 0
nice 0
; 0
I 0
look 0
forward 0
to 0
years 0
of 0
use 0
, 0
it 0
has 0
held 0
up 0
well 0
over 0
the 0
years 0
and 0
it 0
fits 0
my 0
needs 0
very 0
well 0
. 0
Im 0
very 0
happy 0
with 0
this 0
computer 0
! 0
But 0
the 0
machine 0
is 0
awesome 0
and 0
iLife 1
is 0
great 0
and 0
I 0
love 0
Snow 1
Leopard 1
X 1
. 0
I 0
thought 0
learning 0
the 0
Mac 1
OS 1
would 0
be 0
hard 0
, 0
but 0
it 0
is 0
easily 0
picked 0
up 0
if 0
you 0
are 0
familiar 0
with 0
a 0
PC 0
. 0
My 0
kids 0
have 0
to 0
take 0
their 0
PCs 0
in 0
once 0
a 0
year 0
to 0
have 0
them 0
debugged 0
. 0
I 0
had 0
static 0
in 0
the 0
output 0
, 0
and 0
I 0
had 0
to 0
reduce 0
the 0
sound 3
output 3
quality 3
to 0
FM 0
as 0
opposed 0
to 0
the 0
default 0
CD 0
. 0
It 0
was 0
a 0
laugh 0
too 0
! 0
Since 0
I 0
purchased 0
my 0
Toshiba 0
netbook 0
, 0
I 0
have 0
been 0
very 0
pleased 0
with 0
it 0
, 0
I 0
have 0
a 0
laptob 0
and 0
a 0
desktop 0
. 0
I 0
bought 0
my 0
macbook 0
a 0
few 0
months 0
ago 0
and 0
it 0
has 0
been 0
my 0
baby 0
ever 0
since 0
. 0
That 0
is 0
how 0
it 0
is 0
able 0
to 0
function 0
better 0
than 0
any 0
other 0
PC 0
. 0
I 0
custom 0
ordered 0
the 0
machine 0
from 0
HP 0
and 0
could 0
NOT 0
understand 0
the 0
techie 3
due 0
to 0
his 0
accent 0
. 0
It 0
is 0
easy 0
to 0
use 1
and 0
lightweight 0
. 0
I 0
went 0
to 0
Toshiba 1
online 1
help 1
and 0
found 0
some 0
suggestions 0
to 0
fix 0
it 0
. 0
It 0
is 0
a 0
bit 0
heavy 0
. 0
after 0
trying 0
to 0
get 0
some 0
help 0
he 0
disconnected 0
on 0
me 0
. 0
They 0
also 0
have 0
a 0
longer 0
service 1
life 1
than 0
other 0
computers 0
I 0
have 0
several 0
friends 0
who 0
still 0
use 0
the 0
older 0
Apple 0
PowerBooks 0
. 0
If 0
you 0
check 0
you 0
will 0
find 0
the 0
same 0
notebook 0
with 0
the 0
above 0
missing 0
ports 2
and 0
a 0
dual 0
core 0
AMD 0
or 0
Intel 0
processor 2
. 0
This 0
laptop 0
is 0
a 0
great 0
price 1
and 0
has 0
a 0
sleek 0
look 1
. 0
I 0
especially 0
like 0
the 0
keyboard 1
which 0
has 0
chiclet 0
type 0
keys 1
. 0
Small 0
screen 0
somewhat 0
limiting 0
but 0
great 0
for 0
travel 0
. 0
One 0
of 0
the 0
primary 0
reasons 0
why 0
I 0
purchased 0
an 0
IPad 0
was 0
to 0
store 0
photographs 0
so 0
that 0
I 0
could 0
show 0
to 0
my 0
customers 0
. 0
Runs 0
Hot 0
I 0
thought 0
we 0
were 0
paying 0
for 0
quality 3
in 0
our 0
decision 0
to 0
buy 0
an 0
Apple 0
product 0
. 0
The 0
gray 1
color 1
was 0
a 0
good 0
choice 0
. 0
This 0
was 0
the 0
second 0
computer 0
and 0
brand 0
bought 0
that 0
day 0
. 0
VERY 0
disappointing 0
: 0
I 0
love 0
this 0
product 0
because 0
it 0
is 0
Toshiba 0
and 0
its 0
15.6 0
. 0
I 0
would 0
like 0
to 0
have 0
volume 3
buttons 3
rather 0
than 0
the 0
adjustment 0
that 0
is 0
on 0
the 0
front 0
. 0
This 0
is 0
my 0
first 0
computer 0
purchase 0
People 0
know 0
what 0
they 0
are 0
talking 0
about 0
and 0
they 0
have 0
pride 0
in 0
the 0
product 0
that 0
they 0
are 0
selling 0
. 0
Would 0
HIGHLY 0
recommend 0
this 0
netbook 0
though 0
. 0
I 0
have 0
had 0
several 0
machines 0
over 0
the 0
years 0
, 0
both 0
for 0
personal 0
and 0
business 0
use 0
. 0
I 0
bought 0
a 0
protector 2
for 0
my 0
key 1
pad 1
and 0
it 0
works 0
great 0
: 0
The 0
magnetic 1
plugin 1
power 1
charging 1
power 1
cord 1
is 0
great 0
I 0
even 0
put 0
it 0
to 0
the 0
test 0
by 0
accident 0
excellent 0
innovation 0
! 0
Well 0
i 0
got 0
this 0
computer 0
from 0
Best 0
Buy 0
and 0
I 0
have 0
had 0
nothing 0
but 0
problems 0
I 0
bought 0
the 0
computer 0
with 0
a 0
virus 0
. 0
It 0
seems 0
they 0
could 0
have 0
updated 0
XP 1
and 0
done 0
without 0
creating 0
Vista 3
. 0
It 0
is 0
easy 0
to 0
use 1
, 0
fast 0
and 0
has 0
great 0
graphics 1
for 0
the 0
money 0
. 0
I 0
decided 0
I 0
wanted 0
a 0
laptop 0
so 0
I 0
went 0
into 0
the 0
BBY 0
store 0
. 0
I 0
like 0
how 0
the 0
Mac 1
OS 1
is 0
so 0
simple 0
and 0
easy 0
to 0
use 1
. 0
While 0
Apple 0
's 0

the 0
fact 0
that 0
they 0
at 0

stand 0
behind 0
their 0

and 0
their 0
support 1

great 0

it 0
would 0
be 0
nice 0
if 0

In 0
the 0
three 0
years 0
I 0
've 0
had 0
my 0
MacBook 0

, 0
I 0
have 0
never 0
had 0
a 0
virus 0
on 0
my 0
computer 0

and 0
I 0
do 0
a 0
lot 0
of 0
work 0
on 0

internet 0
. 0
I 0
was 0
ready 0
to 0
take 0
it 0
back 0

a 0
refund 0

the 0
Geek 1

camed 0
through 0
and 0
pointed 0
me 0
in 0
the 0
right 0
direction 0
to 0
get 0
it 0
fixed 0
. 0
I 0
have 0
had 0
laptops 0
in 0
the 0
past 0
and 0
I 0
thought 0
why 0
not 0
give 0
these 0
small 0
netbooks 0
a 0
try 0
. 0
It 0
ca 0
n't 0
get 0
any 0
better 0

All 0
the 0
problems 0
I 0
have 0
had 0
with 0
PC 0
's 0
are 0
solved 0
with 0
a 0
Mac 0
: 0
the 0
issue 0
of 0
overheatingmy 0
Dell 0
was 0
always 0
overheating 0
and 0
not 0
working 0
properly 0
or 0
simply 0
shutting 0
off 0
, 0
and 0
the 0
issue 0
of 0
viruses 0
and 0
contaminantsmy 0
HP 0
completely 0
quit 0
working 0
within2 0
years 0
of 0
purchasing 0
it 0
, 0
with 0
no 0
inexpensive 0
way 0
of 0
fixing 0
it 0
. 0
only 0
good 0
thing 0
is 0
the 0
graphics 1
quality 1
. 0
The 0
other 0
lockup 0
problems 0
are 0
from 0
a 0
myriad 0
of 0
causes 0
, 0
the 0
most 0
common 0
being 0
a 0
corrupted 0
version 0
of 0
Appleworks 3
which 0
can 0
render 0
the 0
browser 3
useless 0
. 0
In 0
short 0
I 0
would 0
never 0
buy 0
a 0
Compaq 0
again 0
. 0
The 0
paint 3
wears 0
off 0
easily 0
due 0
to 0
the 0
keyboard 3
being 0
farther 0
back 0
than 0
usual 0
. 0
That 0
's 0
right 0
, 0
no 0
power 0
, 0
absolutely 0
NOTHING 0
. 0
I 0
had 0
purchased 0
it 0
from 0
a 0
major 0
electronics 0
store 0
and 0
took 0
it 0
to 0
their 0
service 2
department 2
to 0
find 0
out 0
what 0
the 0
problem 0
was 0
. 0
The 0
store 0
honored 0
their 0
warrenty 1
and 0
made 0
the 0
comment 0
that 0
they 0
do 0
n't 0
even 0
recommend 0
the 0
HP 0
brand 0
because 0
of 0
the 0
problems 0
with 0
their 0
warrentys 1
. 0
But 0
I 0
was 0
wrong 0
. 0
NO 0
good 0
. 0
I 0
always 0
use 0
a 0
backup 0
hard 2
disk 2
to 0
store 0
important 0
files 0
at 0
all 0
times 0
. 0
But 0
the 0
screen 1
size 1
is 0
not 0
that 0
bad 0
for 0
email 0
and 0
web 2
browsing 2
. 0
Once 0
I 0
removed 0
all 0
the 0
software 3
the 0
laptop 0
loads 2
in 0
1520 0
seconds 0
. 0
On 0
my 0
PowerBook 0
G4 0
I 0
would 0
never 0
use 0
the 0
trackpad 3
I 0
would 0
use 0
an 0
external 2
mouse 2
because 0
I 0
did 0
n't 0
like 0
the 0
trackpad 3
. 0
This 0
computer 0
does 0
n't 0
do 0
that 0
well 0
with 0
certain 0
games 3
it 0
ca 0
n't 0
play 0
some 0
and 0
it 0
becomes 0
too 0
hot 0
while 0
playing 0
games 3
. 0
Obviously 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
most 0
important 0
features 2
of 0
any 0
computer 0
is 0
the 0
human 2
interface 2
. 0
The 0
body 3
is 0
a 0
bit 0
cheaply 0
made 0
so 0
it 0
will 0
be 0
interesting 0
to 0
see 0
how 0
long 0
it 0
holds 0
up 0
. 0
The 0

blows 0
my 0
desktop 0
out 0
of 0
the 0
water 0
when 0
it 0
comes 0
to 0
rendering 0

With 0
a 0

you 0
do 0
n't 0
have 0
to 0
worry 0
about 0
antivirus 2
software 2
or 0
firewall 2
, 0
it 0
's 0
so 0
wonderful 0

For 0
the 0

very 0
glad 0

bought 0

, 0
low 0
price 1
. 0
Obviously 0
, 0
this 0
Macbook 0
is 0
PERFECT 0
for 0
me 0
because 0
it 0
does 0
exactly 0
what 0
I 0
need 0
in 0
an 0
easytofunction 0
way 0

Worth 0
the 0
investment 0
and 0
truly 0
a 0
fine 0
piece 0
of 0
equipment 0

The 0
Apple 1
team 1
also 0
assists 0
you 0
very 0
nicely 0
when 0
choosing 0
which 0

is 0
right 0
for 0
you 0
: 0
The 0
video 3

is 0
the 0
only 0
thing 0
that 0
is 0
iffy 0
about 0
it 0
but 0
im 0
sure 0
once 0
they 0
unpdate 0
the 0
next 0
version 0
on 0
the 0
macbook 0
book 0
the 0
quality 0
of 0
it 0
will 0
be 0
better 0

You 0
'll 0
need 0
to 0
upgrade 0
and 0
pay 0
a 0
little 0
more 0
for 0
them 0
. 0
it 0
is 0
hard 0

it 0

all 0
how 0
you 0

8 0

A 0
great 0

can 0
search 0

about 0
25 0

My 0

never 0

without 0

'll 0
rather 0

spend 0

I 0
had 0
to 0
remove 0
it 0

reloaded 0
with 0
Windows 3

the 0

I 0
am 0
adjusting 0

assuring 0

it 0

was 0
a 0
horrible 0
experience 0

It 0
runs 1
perfectly 0

Very 0
dissappointed 0
becase 0
I 0
have 0
had 0

for 0
years 0

never 0
a 0
issue 0

If 0
you 0

any 0
creativity 0
in 0
you 0
do 0
yourself 0
a 0
favor 0

a 0

! 0
Congratulations 0
Asus 0
for 0
creating 0
one 0
big 0
piece 0
of 0
dump 0
which 0
is 0
my 0
laptop 0
. 0
Sometimes 0
the 0
screen 3
even 0
goes 0
black 0
on 0
this 0
computer 0
. 0
I 0
would 0
definitely 0
recommend 0
checking 0
out 0
this 0
laptop 0
if 0
you 0
are 0
in 0
the 0
market 0
for 0
one 0
. 0
I 0
recommend 0
for 0
word 1
processing 1
and 0
internet 1
users 0
. 0
Since 0
I 0
've 0
had 0
this 0
computer 0
I 0
've 0
only 0
used 0
the 0
trackpad 1
because 0
it 0
is 0
so 0
nice 0
and 0
smooth 0
. 0
When 0
the 0
computer 0
has 0
been 0
on 0
for 0
several 0
minutes 0
, 0
it 0
will 0
occasionaly 0
just 0
go 0
off 0
by 0
itself 0
. 0
Who 0
could 0
n't 0
love 0
a 0
DVD 1
burner 1
, 0
80gigabyte 0
HD 1
, 0
and 0
fairly 0
new 0
graphics 1
chip 1
? 0
As 0
I 0
soon 0
discovered 0
, 0
though 0
, 0
there 0
is 0
a 0
reason 0
for 0
which 0
similarlyconfigured 0
Sony 0
and 0
Toshiba 0
machines 0
cost 0
more 0
: 0
they 0
use 0
higherquality 0
components 1
that 0
are 0
faster 0
, 0
betterconfigured 0
, 0
and 0
end 0
up 0
lasting 0
a 0
lot 0
longer 0
. 0
falls 0
into 0
the 0
case 0
. 0
This 0
is 0
something 0
i 0
would 0
deffinately 0
reccomend 0
to 0
someone 0
. 0
Its 0
fast 0
and 0
another 0
thing 0
I 0
like 0
is 0
that 0
it 0
has 0
three 0
USB 1
ports 1
. 0
Mac 0
computers 0
automatically 0
defrag 0
each 0
time 0
you 0
start 0
your 0
computer 0
. 0
That 0
is 0
my 0
only 0
complaint 0
! 0
The 0
salesman 0
talked 0
us 0
into 0
this 0
computer 0
away 0
from 0
another 0
we 0
were 0
looking 0
at 0
and 0
we 0
have 0
had 0
nothing 0
but 0
problems 0
with 0
software 3
problems 0
and 0
just 0
not 0
happy 0
with 0
it 0
. 0
That 0
system 2
is 0
fixed 0
. 0
The 0
computer 0
itself 0
was 0
fast 0
, 0
ran 1
smoothly 0
, 0
and 0
had 0
no 0
problems 0
. 0
One 0
of 0
the 0
smartest 0
thing 0
I 0
did 0
was 0
take 0
my 0
time 0
to 0
compare 0
laptops 0
before 0
making 0
my 0
purchase 0
. 0
Like 0
the 0
price 1
and 0
operation 1
. 0
The 0
brand 3
is 0
tarnished 0
in 0
my 0
heart 0
. 0
This 0
is 0
likely 0
due 0
to 0
poor 0
grounding 0
and 0
isolation 0
between 0
the 0
components 3
, 0
and 0
I 0
'm 0
hoping 0
that 0
it 0
can 0
be 0
fixed 0
with 0
a 0

really 0
help 0
them 0

I 0
would 0
not 0

this 0
to 0
anyone 0

a 0
notebook 0
expecting 0
the 0
performance 3
of 0
a 0
Desktop 0
it 0
does 0
not 0
meet 0
the 0
expectations 0
. 0
The 0
Macbook 0
arrived 0
in 0
a 0
nice 0
twin 1
packing 1

sealed 0
in 0
the 0

, 0
all 0
the 0

works 0
great 0
. 0
they 0
have 0
not 0
sent 0
a 0
new 0
one 0
nor 0
called 0
. 0
I 0
would 0
easly 0
reccomend 0
this 0
laptop 0
to 0
a 0
friend 0
. 0
I 0
spent 0
alot 0
of 0
money 0
on 0
this 0
product 0
and 0
its 0
been 0
a 0
nightmare 0
. 0
I 0
also 0
like 0
the 0
acer 1
arcade 1
but 0
these 0
were 0
reallythe 0
only 0
two 0
things 0
I 0
liked 0
about 0
this 0
laptop 0
. 0
Have 0
not 0
yet 0
needed 0
any 0
customer 1
support 1
with 0
this 0
yet 0
so 0
to 0
me 0
that 0
is 0
a 0
great 0
thing 0
, 0
which 0
is 0
leaps 0
and 0
bounds 0
ahead 0
of 0
PC 0
in 0
my 0
opinion 0
. 0
Thinking 0
about 0
returning 0
it 0
I 0
gave 0
it 0
to 0
my 0
daughter 0
because 0
I 0
just 0
hated 0
the 0
screen 3
, 0
hated 0
that 0
it 0
had 0
no 0
cd 3
drive 3
to 0
at 0
least 0
play 0
cd 0
's 0
when 0
I 0
wanted 0
to 0
listen 0
to 0
music 0
and 0
do 0
schoolwork 0
. 0
It 0
runs 1
very 0
quiet 0
too 0
which 0
is 0
a 0
plus 0
. 0
but 0
it 0
has 0
a 0
major 0
design 3
flaw 0
. 0
I 0
took 0
the 0
laptop 0
home 0
and 0
not 0
even 0
a 0
month 0
later 0
, 0
I 0
began 0
to 0
have 0
problems 0
with 0
it 0
. 0
That 0
was 0
my 0
first 0
Apple 0
product 0
and 0
since 0
then 0
I 0
have 0
been 0
incredibly 0
happy 0
with 0
every 0
product 0
of 0
theirs 0
I 0
have 0
bought 0
. 0
i 0
tried 0
turning 0
it 0

nothing 0

super 0
fast 0

and 0
always 0
loads 0
. 0
The 0
games 2
included 0
are 0
very 0
good 0
games 2
. 0
I 0
bought 0
mine 0
from 0
Apple 0
Store 0
the 0
day 0
it 0
was 0
released 0
as 0
Amazon 0
did 0
n't 0
have 0
it 0
yet 0
. 0
I 0
had 0
something 0
else 0
go 0
wrong 0
and 0
they 0
said 0
it 0
had 0
to 0
be 0
in 0
good 0
working 0
order 0
to 0
be 0
able 0
to 0
buy 0
the 0
warranty 3
. 0
the 0
whole 0

is 0
horrible 0
so 0
save 0
up 0
and 0

better 0
laptop 0

I 0
just 0
bought 0
this 0
laptop 0
3 0
days 0

have 0
to 0
tap 0
the 0

to 0
get 0
it 0
to 0
worki 0
It 0
's 0
super 0
fast 0
and 0
a 0
great 0
value 1

very 0
few 0
problems 0
with 0

when 0

A 0
mac 0
is 0
very 0
easy 0
to 0
use 1
and 0
it 0
simply 0
makes 0
sense 0
. 0
Of 0
course 0
, 0
eMachines 0
can 0
not 0
be 0
made 0
entirely 0
to 0
blame 0

this 0

I 0
may 0
have 0
inadvertently 0
thrown 0
out 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
batteries 2
with 0
the 0
shipping 2
carton 2

Love 0
it 0
so 0
far 0
. 0
It 0
is 0
so 0
much 0
easier 0
to 0
use 1
There 0
is 0
no 0
need 0
to 0
open 0
a 0
program 1
first 0
and 0
the 0
cliick 0
open 0
or 0
import 0
. 0
In 0
short 0
, 0
you 0
could 0
say 0
your 0

could 0
become 0
your 0
best 0
friend 0
no 0
intention 0
of 0
replacing 0
Rover 0
your 0
dog 0
. 0
It 0
was 0
a 0
bad 0
experience 0
but 0
i 0
played 0
down 0
its 0
importance 0
. 0
Meets 0
my 0
needs 0
perfectly 0
and 0
is 0
light 0
enough 0
for 0
this 0
senior 0
to 0
carry 0
without 0
affecting 0
my 0
arthritis 0
. 0
It 0
is 0
so 0
nice 0
not 0
to 0
worry 0
about 0
that 0
and 0
the 0
extra 0
expense 0
that 0
comes 0
along 0
with 0
the 0
necessary 0
virus 1
protection 1
on 0
PC 0
's 0
. 0
Three 0
weeks 0
after 0
I 0
bought 0
the 0
netbook 0
, 0
the 0
screen 3
quit 0
working 0
. 0
The 0
processor 1
screams 0
, 0
and 0
because 0
of 0
the 0
unique 0
way 0
that 0
Apple 0
OSX 1
16 1
functions 0
, 0
most 0
of 0
the 0
graphics 1
are 0
routed 0
through 0
the 0
hardware 2
rather 0
than 0
the 0
software 2
. 0
I 0
am 0
currently 0
out 0
of 0
town 0
and 0
called 0
to 0
inform 0
them 0
the 0
broken 0
part 0
would 0
be 0
returned 0
when 0
I 0
got 0
back 0
in 0
town 0
. 0
Returned 0
laptop 0
for 0
a 0
4th 0
repair 0
and 0
it 0
came 0
back 0
but 0
now 0
would 0
lock 0
up 0
and 0
randomly 0
reboot 0
frequently 0
making 0
the 0
laptop 0
unusable 0
. 0
I 0
wanted 0
something 0
that 0
had 0
a 0
new 0
Intel 2
Core 2
processors 2
and 0
HDMI 2
port 2
so 0
that 0
we 0
could 0
hook 0
it 0
up 0
directly 0
to 0
our 0
TV 0
. 0
The 0
Apple 0
will 0
run 0
Internet 0

but 0
at 0
an 0
amazingly 0
slow 0
rate 0
. 0
With 0
today 0
's 0
company 0
fighting 0
over 0

, 0
its 0
a 0
shame 0
that 0

get 0
away 0
with 0
the 0
inept 0
staff 3

Other 0
than 0
that 0
I 0
do 0

The 0

even 0
after 0
paying 0
staples 0
the 0
extra 0
money 0
to 0
speed 0
it 0
up 0
. 0
I 0
feel 0
that 0
enough 0
people 0
have 0
Macs 0
these 0
days 0
and 0
that 0
companies 0
need 0
to 0
start 0
making 0
things 0
more 0
compatable 0
than 0
they 0
used 0
to 0
be 0
. 0
The 0
price 3
premium 3
is 0
a 0
little 0
much 0
, 0
but 0
when 0
you 0
start 0
looking 0
at 0
the 0

it 0
is 0
worth 0

added 0

Anyways 0
I 0
bought 0
this 0
two 0
months 0
ago 0
and 0
when 0
I 0
first 0
brought 0
it 0
home 0
it 0
kept 0

The 0

Pavillion 0

was 0
my 0
first 0
laptop 0
, 0
before 0
this 0
I 0
had 0
a 0
Dell 0

I 0
loved 0

Features 3
like 0
the 0
font 3
are 0
very 0
blocklike 0
and 0
old 0
school 0
. 0
It 0
has 0
everything 0
you 0
need 0
to 0
get 0
the 0
job 0
done 0
. 0
It 0
is 0
loaded 0
with 0
programs 3
that 0
is 0
of 0
no 0
good 0
for 0
the 0
average 0
user 0
, 0
that 0
makes 0
it 0
run 3
way 0
to 0
slow 0
. 0
I 0
feel 0
that 0
it 0
was 0
poorly 0
put 0
together 0
, 0
because 0
once 0
in 0
a 0
while 0
different 0
plastic 3
pieces 3
would 0
come 0
off 0
of 0
it 0
. 0
Finally 0
, 0
I 0
should 0
note 0
that 0
I 0
took 0
the 0
2GB 2
RAM 2
stick 2
from 0
my 0
old 0
EeePC 0
and 0
installed 0
it 0
before 0
I 0
even 0
powered 0
on 0
for 0
the 0
first 0
time 0
. 0
This 0
laptop 0
has 0
left 0
me 0
with 0
a 0
HORRIBLE 0
taste 0
in 0
my 0
mouth 0
for 0
Acer 0
brand 0
products 0
. 0
its 0
not 0
bad 0
just 0
VERY 0
VERY 0
annoying 0

Well 0

maybe 0
more 0
like 0
week 0
one 0

also 0
rather 0
unsteady 0
on 0
its 0
feet 0

is 0
susceptible 0
to 0
many 0
bugs 0

After 0
sending 0

having 0
recipients 0
tell 0
me 0
they 0
could 0
not 0
open 0
the 0
documents 0

they 0
came 0
through 0
as 0
gibberish 0
, 0
I 0
broke 0
down 0
and 0
spent 0
another 0
$ 0
100 0
to 0
get 0
Microsoft 2
Word 2
for 2
Mac 2

I 0
believe 0

I 0
have 0
a 0
laptop 0
as 0
my 0
regular 0
computer 0
, 0
but 0
found 0
that 0
disconnecting 0
it 0
and 0
lugging 0
it 0
around 0
was 0
a 0
drag 0
. 0
This 0
is 0
my 0
second 0
MacBook 0
. 0
The 0
size 1
is 0
perfect 0
and 0
I 0
do 0
not 0
recomend 0
anything 0
bigger 0
except 0
for 0
any 0
person 0
who 0
can 0
exceed 0
the 0

The 0
service 1
I 0
received 0
from 0
Toshiba 0
went 0
above 0
and 0
beyond 0
the 0
call 0
of 0
duty 0
. 0
Have 0
had 0
many 0
higher 0
priced 3
computers 0
crash 0
and 0
burn 0
long 0
before 0
ever 0
got 0
to 0
use 0
all 0
that 0
great 0
memory 3
and 0
speed 3
, 0
etc 0
. 0
I 0
would 0
recommend 0
it 0
just 0
because 0
of 0
the 0
internet 1
speed 1
probably 0
because 0
thats 0
the 0
only 0
thing 0
i 0
really 0
care 0
about 0
. 0
I 0
own 0
other 0
Macs 0
but 0
always 0
find 0
myself 0
navigation 0
to 0
the 0
MacBook 0

to 0
get 0
my 0
work 0
done 0
. 0
This 0
is 0
my 0
3rd 0
Apple 0
Laptop 0
and 0
first 0
MacBook 0

I 0
have 0
had 0
this 0
laptop 0
for 0
a 0
few 0
months 0
now 0
and 0
i 0
would 0
say 0
im 0
pretty 0
satisfied 0
. 0
The 0
love 0
part 0
of 0
my 0
relationship 0
with 0
this 0
laptop 0
does 0
n't 0
take 0
very 0
long 0
. 0
Not 0
enough 0
time 0
for 0
me 0
to 0
give 0
it 0
5 0
stars 0
! 0
The 0
screen 1
shows 0
great 0
colors 1
. 0
That 0
's 0
a 0
huge 0
difference 0
. 0
Dells 0
are 0
ok 0
, 0
HPs 0
are 0
n't 0
that 0
good 0
, 0
but 0
Macs 0
or 0
Fantastic 0
. 0
I 0
am 0
totally 0
satisfied 0
with 0
my 0
little 0
toshie 0
! 0
Again 0
, 0
I 0
sent 0
it 0
off 0
to 0
Acer 0
, 0
by 0
this 0
time 0
they 0
were 0
paying 0
for 0
me 0
to 0
send 0
it 0
to 0
them 0
and 0
everything 0
, 0
but 0
it 0
was 0
still 0
inconvienent 0
because 0
of 0
my 0
classes 0
and 0
my 0
communication 0
with 0
my 0
fiance 0
. 0
It 0
is 0
extremely 0
user 0
friendly 0
and 0
intuitive 0
. 0
Let 0
me 0
start 0
with 0
the 0
good 0
: 0
So 0
awesome 0
. 0
I 0
had 0
finally 0
reached 0
my 0
limit 0
and 0
broke 0
down 0
. 0
The 0
17 3
inch 3
screen 3
is 0
very 0
large 0
, 0
but 0
the 0
computer 0
is 0
very 0
light 0
. 0
My 0
opinion 0
of 0
Sony 0
has 0
been 0
dropping 0
as 0
fast 0
as 0
the 0
stock 0
market 0
, 0
given 0
their 0
horrible 0
support 3
, 0
but 0
this 0
machine 0
just 0
caused 0
another 0
plunge 0
. 0
I 0
waited 0
and 0
waited 0
and 0
no 0
laptop 0
. 0
Everything 0
is 0
falling 0
apart 0
internally 0
and 0
externally 0
. 0
I 0
also 0
liked 0
the 0
glass 1
screen 1
. 0
The 0
switchable 1
graphic 1
card 1
is 0
pretty 0
sweet 0
when 0
you 0
want 0
gaming 2
on 0
the 0
laptop 0
. 0
It 0
super 0
shiny 0
, 0
so 0
you 0
can 0
see 0
the 0
fingerprints 0
easily 0
. 0
The 0
battery 1
life 1
has 0
not 0
decreased 0
since 0
I 0
bought 0
it 0
, 0
so 0
i 0
'm 0
thrilled 0
with 0
that 0
. 0
When 0
I 0
called 0
Toshiba 0
, 0
they 0
would 0
not 0
do 0
anything 0
and 0
even 0
tried 0
to 0
charge 0
me 0
$ 0
35 0
for 0
the 0
phone 0
call 0
, 0
even 0
though 0
they 0
did 0
n't 0
offer 0
any 0
technical 3
support 3
. 0
I 0
bought 0
this 0
notebook 0
and 0
only 0
had 0
it 0
for 0
3 0
months 0
If 0
it 0
is 0
overload 0
with 0
updates 0
the 0
BOOT 2
MGR 2
. 0
Oh 0
and 0
if 0
thats 0
not 0
bad 0
enough 0
it 0
does 0
n't 0
come 0
with 0
a 0
recovery 3
cd 3
so 0
you 0
can 0
make 0
one 0
if 0
you 0
know 0
how 0
to 0
or 0
buy 0
one 0
if 0
you 0
buy 0
it 0
the 0
cost 0
is 0
$ 0
25 0
for 0
two 0
cds 0
. 0
The 0
price 1
and 0
features 1
more 0
than 0
met 0
my 0
needs 0
. 0
They 0
refuse 0
. 0
big 0
mistake 0
! 0
and 0
dell 0
and 0
best 0
buy 0
both 0
refused 0
to 0
take 0
it 0
back 0
after 0
i 0
only 0
had 0
it 0
for 0
1 0
hour. 0
. 0
My 0
friends 0
or 0
children 0
use 0
that 0
when 0
they 0
need 0
to 0
borrow 0
the 0
Net 0

When 0
I 0
out 0
grow 0
this 0
Meaning 0
when 0
its 0

TOSHIBA 0

First 0
of 0
all 0
, 0
I 0
've 0
been 0
Dell 0
fan 0
for 0
more 0
than 0
fifteen 0
years 0
. 0
GREAT 0
INVESTMENT 0
! 0
I 0
am 0
just 0
amazed 0
. 0
I 0
burned 0
my 0
leg 0
, 0
after 0
lifting 0
it 0
from 0
my 0
desk 0
, 0
and 0
for 0
less 0
than 0
5 0
second 0
putting 0
it 0
on 0
my 0
lap 0
to 0
clean 0
my 0
coffee 0
table 0
, 0
so 0
I 0
can 0
place 0
it 0
there 0
. 0
I 0
thought 0
all 0
my 0
problems 0
would 0
finally 0
be 0
solved 0
being 0
that 0
my 0
old 0
computer 0
would 0
n't 0
go 0
onto 0
our 0
wireless 0
network 0
and 0
I 0
would 0
n't 0
have 0
the 0
same 0
problems 0
because 0
it 0
was 0
updated 0
. 0
Skype 1
is 0
just 0
so 0
dang 0
cool 0
with 0
this 0
machine 0
too 0
. 0
I 0
would 0
buy 0
this 0
lap 0
top 0
over 0
and 0
over 0
again 0
! 0
the 0
mouse 3
buttons 3
are 0
hard 0
to 0
push 0
. 0
Also 0
, 0
HDD 1
secures 0
inside 0
using 0
rails 2
, 0
and 0
there 0
is 0
only 0
one 0
set 0
on 0
the 0
main 0
hard 2
drive 2
. 0
If 0
you 0
're 0
not 0
wanting 0
to 0
be 0
mobile 0
, 0
this 0
is 0
a 0
good 0
laptop 0
to 0
sit 0
on 0
a 0
desk 0
. 0
I 0
also 0
travel 0
with 0
it 0
and 0
it 0
never 0
gives 0
me 0
any 0
problems 0
. 0
Just 0
do 0
n't 0
waste 0
your 0
time 0
and 0
money 0
on 0
this 0
. 0
All 0
I 0
will 0
say 0
now 0
is 0
that 0
it 0
was 0
over 0
two 0
grand 0
less 0
expensive 0
and 0
so 0
much 0
better 0
quality 1
than 0
my 0
hunk 0
of 0
crap 0
Vaio 0

Bought 0

hope 0
you 0
have 0
your 0
own 0
copies 0

They 0
are 0
wonderful 0
, 0

very 0
dangerous 0
when 0
it 0
comes 0
to 0
emitting 0
heat 0
. 0
This 0

was 0
awful 0
! 0
Heck 0
, 0
if 0

had 0
enough 0
money 0
, 0
I 0
would 0
but 0
it 0
as 0
a 0

The 0

It 0
is 0
very 0

out 0
at 0

The 0
Nortons 3
virus 3

is 0
only 0
for 0
a 0
very 0
short 0
time 0
unlike 0
others 0
that 0
usually 0
are 0
good 0
for 0
a 0
year 0
. 0
It 0
is 0
stamped 0
and 0
not 0
in 0
pieces 0
therefore 0
it 0
is 0
a 0
stronger 0
more 0
resilient 0
frame 1
. 0
I 0
am 0
first 0
time 0
Mac 0
Buyer 0
and 0
am 0
amazed 0
at 0
features 1
and 0
ease 0
of 0
use 1
the 0
Mac 0
offers 0
. 0
Two 0
, 0
owning 0

the 0
flexibility 0
to 0
sit 0
anywhere 0
you 0
want 0
without 0

anyone 0
. 0
Sent 0
unit 0
back 0
and 0
it 0
's 0
been 0
two 0
months 0
. 0
I 0
noticed 0
windows 2
has 0
a 0
new 0
system 0
called 0
Windows 2
7 2
, 0
what 0
about 0
us 0
Vista 2
users 0
? 0
They 0
should 0
get 0
all 0
the 0
bugs 0
out 0
of 0
Vista 2
before 0
investing 0
in 0
a 0
new 0
system 0
. 0
When 0
we 0
bought 0
our 0
new 0
HP 0
comouter 0
in 0
Dec. 0
of 0
2008 0
, 0
we 0
wanted 0
Windows 0
XP 0
, 0
but 0
were 0
told 0
it 0
would 0
cost 0
an 0
extra 0
$ 0
159 0
, 0
so 0
we 0
went 0
with 0
Vista 2
. 0
I 0
definatly 0
ca 0
n't 0
. 0
Files 0
as 0
well 0
would 0
become 0
lost 0
, 0
deleted 0
or 0
corrupted 0
. 0
It 0
is 0
meant 0
to 0
be 0
PORTABLE 0
. 0
My 0
laptop 0
worked 0
again 0
for 0
just 0
a 0
while 0
before 0
I 0
started 0
having 0
issues 0
AGAIN 0
. 0
This 0
is 0
perfect 0
for 0
her 0
field 0
. 0
taking 0
it 0
back 0
less 0
than 0
24 0
hours 0
of 0
purchase 0
The 0
only 0
thing 0
that 0
I 0
have 0
, 0
is 0
the 0
key 3
broad 3
is 0
a 0
little 0
dark 0
to 0
see 0
the 0
letters 0
, 0
would 0
help 0
if 0
it 0
was 0
a 0
little 0
lighter 0
then 0
it 0
is 0
. 0
Hopefully 0
Amazon 0
will 0
take 0
this 0
back 0
. 0
They 0
ended 0
up 0
keeping 0
my 0
computer 0
for 0
almost 0
3 0
months 0
! 0
I 0
'm 0
still 0
within 0
the 0
one 0
year 0
warranty 3
but 0
the 0
repair 3
depot 3
has 0
deemed 0
that 0
this 0
time 0
it 0
was 0
caused 0
by 0
physical 0
abuse 0
and 0
is 0
not 0
covered 0
. 0
But 0
I 0
needed 0
a 0
laptop 0
for 0
school 2
use 2
. 0
he 0
ca 0
n't 0
stand 0
it 0
. 0
The 0
computer 0
was 0
delivered 0
as 0
promised 0
. 0
This 0
is 0
the 0
complete 0
opposite 0
to 0
an 0
ergonomic 0
design 3
. 0
I 0
would 0
like 0
at 0
least 0
a 0
4 0
hr. 0
battery 2
life 2
. 0
The 0
only 0
thing 0
that 0
I 0
do 0
n't 0
like 0
about 0
my 0
mac 0
is 0
that 0
sometimes 0
there 0
are 0
programs 3
that 0
I 0
want 0
to 0
be 0
able 0
to 0
run 0
and 0
I 0
am 0
not 0
able 0
to 0
. 0
Looking 0
online 0
, 0
many 0
people 0
are 0
having 0
the 0
same 0
problem 0
. 0
Wireless 1
has 0
not 0
been 0
a 0
issue 0
for 0
me 0
, 0
like 0
some 0
others 0
have 0
meantioned 0
. 0
THIS 0
IS 0
MY 0
SECOND 0
MAC 0
BOOK 0
PRO 0
. 0
MacBook 0
Notebooks 0
quickly 0
die 0
out 0
because 0
of 0
their 0
short 0
battery 3
life 3
, 0
as 0
well 0
as 0
the 0
many 0
background 0
programs 3
that 0
run 0
without 0
the 0
user 0
's 0
knowlede 0
. 0
All 0
the 0
things 0
you 0
can 0
do 0
with 0
the 0
trackpad 1
make 0
navigating 1
around 0
the 0
computer 0
and 0
its 0
programs 1
so 0
much 0
simpler 0
, 0
quicker 0
, 0
and 0
easier 0
. 0
I 0
guess 0
the 0
only 0
good 0
thing 0
that 0
came 0
out 0
of 0
these 0
were 0
the 0
speakers 1
and 0
the 0
subwoofer 1
. 0
Theres 0
a 0
built 1
in 1
camera 1
with 0
special 0
effects 0
for 0
video 0
and 0
photography 0
. 0
All 0
for 0
such 0
a 0
great 0
price 1
. 0
I 0
went 0
right 0
out 0
and 0
purchased 0
another 0
laptop 0
. 0
Long 0
story 0
short 0
, 0
since 0
I 0
experience 0
so 0
many 0
problems 0
with 0
my 0
laptop 0
every 0
since 0
I 0
bought 0
it 0
from 0
day 0
one 0
, 0
I 0
did 0
n't 0
ask 0
for 0
a 0
new 0
laptop 0
or 0
a 0
refund 0
of 0
what 0
I 0
pay 0
for 0
a 0
crapy 0
laptop 0
, 0
but 0
just 0
an 0
extension 0
of 0
my 0
laptop 0
warranty 2
for 0
another 0
year 0
, 0
they 0
made 0
a 0
big 0
deal 0
of 0
out 0
that 0
and 0
after 0
so 0
many 0
calls 0
and 0
complaints 0
about 0
their 0
products 0
and 0
services 0
, 0
they 0
finally 0
gave 0
in 0
. 0
I 0
am 0
able 0
to 0
play 0
720p 0
and 0
1080p 0
media 0
files 0
just 0
fine 0
with 0
it 0
. 0
I 0
already 0
own 0
an 0
iPhone 0
, 0
and 0
so 0
the 0
move 0
just 0
made 0
more 0
sense 0
. 0
So 0
think 0
about 0
factoring 0
those 0
things 0
in 0
when 0
you 0
purchase 0
. 0
Took 0
the 0
netbook 0
on 0
a 0
vacation 0
trip 0
and 0
I 0
was 0
able 0
to 0
do 0
whatever 0
I 0
wanted 0
to 0
do 0
without 0
lugging 0
a 0
much 0
heavier 0
laptop 0
. 0
Everything 0
was 0
up 0
and 0
running 0
within 0
15 0
minutes 0
of 0
unboxing 0
. 0
This 0
computer 0
gets 0
very 0
hot 0
, 0
before 0
shutting 0
down 0
. 0
Another 0
thing 0
is 0
that 0
after 0
only 0
a 0
month 0
the 0
left 3
mouse 3
key 3
broke 0
and 0
it 0
costed 2
$ 0
175 0
to 0
send 0
it 0
in 0
to 0
fix 0
it 0
. 0
Went 0
silently 0
. 0
Satisfy 0
what 0
I 0
paid 0
for 0
it 0
. 0
IT 0
IS 0
TRASH 0
! 0
Clear 0
picture 1
on 0
it 0
and 0
everything 0
. 0
Overall 0
though 0
, 0
for 0
the 0
money 0
spent 0
it 0
's 0
a 0
great 0
deal 0
. 0
So 0
you 0
do 0
n't 0
get 0
frustrated 0
the 0
first 0
few 0
weeks 0
. 0
They 0
said 0
that 0
my 0
computer 0
was 0
covered 0
on 0
an 0
extended 2
warranty 2
, 0
and 0
that 0
products 0
with 0
extended 2
warranties 2
are 0
taken 0
care 0
of 0
through 0
third 0
parties 0
and 0
not 0
Sony 0
itself 0
anymore 0
. 0
It 0
is 0
truly 0
a 0
Desktop 0
Replacement 0
. 0
A 0
little 0
pricey 0
but 0
it 0
is 0
well 0
, 0
well 0
worth 0
it 0
. 0
Very 0
longlife 0
battery 1
up 0
to 0
1011 0
hours 0
depending 0
on 0
how 0
you 0
configure 0
power 0
level 0
settings 0
. 0
Screen 1
is 0
awesome 0
, 0
battery 1
life 1
is 0
good 0
. 0
In 0
my 0
opinion 0
it 0
was 0
not 0
as 0
user 0
friendly 0
as 0
I 0
expected 0
either 0
. 0
The 0
technical 3
service 3
for 3
dell 3
is 0
so 0
3rd 0
world 0
it 0
might 0
as 0
well 0
not 0
even 0
bother 0
. 0
The 0
graphics 3
were 0
awful 0
and 0
the 0
warranty 3
is 0
n't 0
even 0
worth 0
the 0
cheap 0
payment 0
on 0
the 0
computer 0
. 0
and 0
if 0
u 0
did 0
. 0
I 0
've 0
had 0
the 0
MacBook 0
Pro 0
15 0
for 0
about 0
three 0
weeks 0
, 0
and 0
it 0
really 0
is 0
a 0
great 0
computer 0
. 0
They 0
gave 0
me 0
a 0
hard 0
time 0
yet 0
again 0
, 0
but 0
their 0
was 0
a 0
malfunction 0
in 0
the 0
battery 3
itself 0
, 0
it 0
did 0
n't 0
die 0
. 0
It 0
was 0
definelty 0
a 0
smart 0
move 0
. 0
I 0
'm 0
excited 0
to 0
learn 0
more 0
about 0
what 0
this 0
powerful 0
machine 0
has 0
to 0
offer 0
and 0
encourage 0
others 0
to 0
do 0
the 0
same 0
. 0
Apparently 0
they 0
are 0
defective 0
since 0
they 0
are 0
not 0
securely 0
attached 0
. 0
but 0
other 0
then 0
that 0
I 0
would 0
give 0
this 0
product 0
a 0
4 0
in 0
hafe 0
stars 0
. 0
Sure 0
hope 0
Best 0
Buy 0
will 0
replace 0
it 0
asap 0
. 0
I 0
babyed 0
the 0
heck 0
out 0
of 0
it 0
and 0
i 0
still 0
do 0
. 0
Handles 0
all 0
my 0
basic 0
media 0
needs 0
easily 0
. 0
Just 0
what 0
the 0
doctor 0
ordered 0
. 0
If 0
you 0
do 0
n't 0
feel 0
comfortable 0
doing 0
it 0
yourself 0
, 0
just 0
buy 0
the 0
case 1
and 0
be 0
happy 0
, 0
plus 0
it 0
looks 0
nice 0
, 0
I 0
bought 0
the 0
white 0
one 0
from 0
Best 0
Buy 0
. 0
The 0
reaction 0
of 0
Toshiba 0
is 0
there 0
is 0
nothing 0
you 0
can 0
do 0
about 0
it 0
so 0
just 0
sit 0
back 0
and 0
except 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
you 0
are 0
powerless 0
and 0
it 0
is 0
mind 0
over 0
matter 0
. 0
you 0
can 0
find 0
many 0
laptops 0
with 0
the 0
same 0
performance 2
and 0
even 0
better 0
with 0
lower 0
price 1
, 0
but 0
you 0
can 0
not 0
find 0
the 0
look 1
, 0
easy 0
, 0
applications 1
, 0
and 0
the 0
experience 0
in 0
mac 0
. 0
Excellent 0
speed 1
for 0
processing 0
data 0
. 0
All 0
in 0
all 0
, 0
I 0
'm 0
incredibly 0
dissatisfied 0
with 0
this 0
laptop 0
, 0
and 0
with 0
HP 0
as 0
a 0
whole 0
. 0
I 0
am 0
not 0
happy 0
at 0
all 0
with 0
the 0
product 0
I 0
purchased 0
. 0
When 0
you 0
call 0
tech 3
support 3
you 0
were 0
routed 0
to 0
someone 0
who 0
was 0
in 0
another 0
country 0
and 0
did 0
not 0
know 0
what 0
they 0
were 0
doing 0
. 0
I 0
was 0
taught 0
to 0
use 0
Photoshop 1
and 0
was 0
amazed 0
. 0
It 0
's 0
A 0
MAC 0
! 0
! 0
I 0
can 0
hardly 0
wait 0
to 0
see 0
whats 0
around 0
the 0
next 0
corner 0
. 0
the 0
apple 0
pro 0
notebook 0
will 0
not 0
let 0
you 0
down 0
. 0
I 0
did 0
a 0
review 0
on 0
it 0
, 0
its 0
awesome 0
. 0
Before 0
we 0
got 0
this 0
laptop 0
, 0
had 0
a 0
compaq 0
pasaro 0
for 0
5 0
years 0
with 0
no 0
problems 0
. 0
I 0
tried 0
out 0
another 0
Mac 0
for 0
a 0

there 0
probably 0
would 0
be 0
no 0

does 0
n't 0
heat 0

kids 0
and 0
abuse 0
and 0
if 0

I 0
'm 0
very 0
happy 0
with 0

great 0
, 0
the 0
only 0
thing 0
it 0
needs 0
is 0
better 0

was 0
still 0

there 0
was 0
nothing 0

obviously 0
unnecessary 0

reduces 0
the 0

The 0

I 0
would 0
suggest 0
a 0
pullbehind 0

had 0
to 0

be 0
a 0
very 0
unstable 0
, 0
unreliable 0
laptop 0
for 0

Also 0

of 0
the 0
size 3

consistancy 3
of 0
the 0

, 0
some 0
websites 0

n't 0
even 0

very 0

I 0
am 0
pretty 0
rough 0
when 0
it 0
comes 0
to 0
electronics 0
and 0
it 0
has 0
taken 0
it 0
all 0
with 0
no 0

. 0
The 0
Macbook 0
is 0
a 0
fantastic 0
laptop 0
. 0
I 0
believe 0
this 0
is 0
because 0
I 0
was 0
more 0
active 0
than 0
the 0
average 0

, 0
meaning 0

about 0

Best 0

A 0
couple 0
things 0
you 0
should 0
know 0
: 0
bought 0
the 0
first 0
asus 0
laptop 0
in 0
san 0
francisco 0
, 0
returned 0
it 0
in 0
santa 0
maria 0
, 0
thinking 0
it 0
was 0
just 0
a 0
problem 0
with 0
that 0
computer 0
. 0
The 0
screen 1
is 0
bright 0
and 0
clear 0
, 0
the 0
operating 1
system 1
is 0
solid 0
and 0
friendly 0
to 0
a 0

The 0
feature 1
are 0
good 0
enough 0
for 0
what 0
I 0
need 0

All 0
the 0
yadayada 0

Finally 0
, 0
the 0
biggest 0
problem 0
has 0
been 0
tech 3
support 3
. 0
this 0
laptop 0
is 0
great 0
for 0
work 0
and 0
doing 0
my 0
pictures 0
. 0
I 0
had 0
the 0
computer 0
for 0
a 0
full 0
year 0
and 0
it 0
was 0
a 0
new 0
computer 0
. 0
This 0
is 0
n't 0
a 0
big 0
deal 0
, 0
I 0
have 0
n't 0
noticed 0
the 0
issue 0
with 0
DVDs 0
or 0
other 0
media 0
, 0
only 0
through 0
USB 3
output 3
. 0
I 0
love 0
it 0
! 0
With 0
Windows 0
laptops 0
a 0
wireless 2
mouse 2
is 0
an 0
absolute 0
must 0
. 0
But 0
if 0
you 0
're 0
willing 0
to 0
pay 0
another 0
200 0
dollar 0
for 0
a 0
windows 2
disc 2
. 0
Very 0
good 0
quality 1
and 0
well 0
made 0
. 0
I 0
bought 0
a 0
Logitech 0
desktop 0
set 0
in 0
anticipation 0
for 0
using 0
with 0
the 0
MBP 0
, 0
but 0
I 0
use 0
the 0
touchpad 1
90 0
% 0
of 0
the 0
time 0
. 0
When 0
calling 0
Dell 0
for 0
help 0
, 0
reurn 0
, 0
or 0
a 0
new 0
computer 0
they 0
were 0
not 0
useful 0
and 0
left 0
it 0
up 0
to 0
myself 0
to 0
figure 0
out 0
what 0
to 0
do 0
with 0
it 0
. 0
Two 0
of 0
the 0
times 0
was 0
in 0
one 0
month 0
. 0
my 0
niece 0
and 0
nephew 0
have 0
played 0
a 0
few 0
web 0
games 0
and 0
it 0
runs 0
anything 0
that 0
does 0
n't 0
require 0
a 0
dedicated 0
video 2
card 2
. 0
Although 0
I 0
was 0
promised 0
about 0
10 0
hours 0
, 0
I 0
found 0
myself 0
to 0
a 0
limited 0
7 0
hours 0
which 0
is 0
still 0
amazing 0
. 0
It 0
had 0
the 0
full 0
sized 0
touch 2
pad 2
with 0
2 0
buttons 0
instead 0
of 0
just 0
one 0
. 0
It 0
was 0
also 0
cheaper 0
than 0
the 0
Pro 0
which 0
made 0
it 0
even 0
more 0
appealing 0
to 0
me 0
. 0
Typically 0
, 0
when 0
I 0
purchase 0
a 0
new 0
laptop 0
I 0
always 0
end 0
up 0
using 0
an 0
external 2
mouse 2
for 0
convenience 0

Consumer 0
Report 0

easy 0
to 0
set 1
up 1
and 0
Is 0
really 0
easy 0
to 0
get 0
used 0

The 0
only 0
thing 0
that 0
can 0

is 0
the 0

My 0

the 0

between 0

early 0
2011 0
and 0
late 0

The 0
only 0
problem 0
is 0
a 0
lack 0
of 0
screen 3
resolutions 3
! 0
Typing 0
on 0
the 0
keyboard 3
becomes 0
uncomfortable 0
after 0
extended 0
use 0
due 0
to 0
the 0
sharp 0
edges 3
that 0
your 0

rest 0
on 0

The 0
processor 3
went 0
on 0
me 0
, 0
the 0
fan 3
went 0
and 0
the 0
motherboard 3
went 0
. 0
I 0
bought 0
my 0
first 0
MacBook 0
after 0
seeing 0
the 0
product 0
demonstrated 0
. 0
It 0
is 0
very 0
well 0
built 1
. 0
Might 0
not 0
make 0
the 0
avid 0
gamer 0
happy 0
but 0
I 0
do 0
n't 0
really 0
think 0
that 0
is 0
what 0
this 0
computer 0
is 0
designed 0
for 0
. 0
I 0
highly 0
recommend 0
this 0
laptop 0
to 0
anybody 0
that 0
wants 0
great 0
performance 1
from 0
a 0
laptop 0
and 0
would 0
like 0
to 0
relax 0
and 0
not 0
become 0
enraged 0
cursing 0
the 0
gods 0
about 0
to 0
throw 0
your 0
laptop 0
out 0
the 0
door 0
. 0
The 0
screen 1
resolution 1
was 0
exactly 0
what 0
I 0
was 0
looking 0
for 0
. 0
Even 0
though 0
it 0
is 0
running 0
Snow 1
Leopard 1
, 0
2.4 0
GHz 0
C2D 0
is 0
a 0
bit 0
of 0
an 0
antiquated 0
CPU 3
and 0
thus 0
the 0
occasional 0
spinning 3
wheel 3
would 0
appear 0
when 0
running 0
Office 3
Mac 3
applications 3
such 0
as 0
Word 3
or 0
Excel 3
. 0
seriously 0
why 0
have 0
n't 0
they 0
just 0
replaced 0
it 0
by 0
now 0
. 0
There 0
is 0
no 0
number 0
pad 3
to 0
the 0
right 0
of 0
the 0
keyboard 3
which 0
is 0
a 0
bummer 0
. 0
After 0
2030 0
min 0
the 0
screen 3
of 0
the 0
notebook 0
switched 0
off 0
. 0
If 0
upgrade 0
is 0
possible 0
to 0
the 0
full 0
Windows 1
7 1
, 0
then 0
I 0
will 0
truly 0
be 0
a 0
very 0
happy 0
geek 0
. 0
I 0
have 0
used 0
both 0
PCs 0
and 0
Macs 0
and 0
I 0
have 0
to 0
say 0
that 0
I 0
really 0
really 0
love 0
my 0
Mac 0
Book 0
Pro 0
. 0
I 0
was 0
originally 0
concerned 0
that 0
I 0
could 0
n't 0
view 0
work 0
I 0
had 0
done 0
in 0
college 0
on 0
my 0
Mac 0
because 0
of 0
the 0
PC 0
formatting 0
, 0
but 0
I 0
was 0
even 0
more 0
thrilled 0
to 0
learn 0
of 0
programs 1
like 0
iLife 1
and 0
iWork 1
that 0
allow 0
you 0
to 0
convert 0
your 0
PC 0
documents 0
into 0
readable 0
files 0
on 0
Macs 0
. 0
I 0
have 0
never 0
had 0
an 0
experience 0
like 0
this 0
. 0
returned 0
it 0
to 0
walmart 0
. 0
10 0
hours 0
of 0
battery 1
life 1
is 0
really 0
something 0
else. 0
. 0
I 0
love 0
everything 0
about 0
it 0
. 0
It 0
's 0
slow 0
and 0
one 0
day 0
i 0
hope 0
to 0
have 0
the 0
money 0
to 0
get 0
rid 0
of 0
it 0
and 0
buy 0
something 0
else 0
. 0
Runs 1
fast 0
and 0
the 0
regular 1
layout 1
keyboard 1
is 0
so 0
much 0
better 0
. 0
All 0
was 0
well 0
. 0
All 0
the 0
programs 1
are 0
easy 0
and 0
straight 0
forward 0
on 0
my 0
MacBook 0
Pro 0
, 0
it 0
is 0
clean 0
and 0
organized 0
, 0
which 0
I 0
always 0
strive 0
to 0
be 0
myself 0
. 0
Not 0
worth 0
it 0
one 0
bit 0
. 0
I 0
reinstalled 0
windows 1
through 0
the 0
recovery 1
discs 1
and 0
everything 0
seemed 0
good 0
again 0
. 0
Windows 1
7 1
Starter 1
is 0
terrific 0
no 0
you 0
ca 0
n't 0
change 0
the 0
background 0
but 0
I 0
do 0
n't 0
need 0
to 0
, 0
I 0
use 0
it 0
just 0
for 0
school 0
work 0
. 0
Support 3
has 0
been 0
lackluster 0
and 0
now 0
I 0
just 0
want 0
a 0
refund 0
. 0
First 0
of 0
all 0
, 0
they 0
had 0
no 0
record 0
of 0
me 0
having 0
the 0
3 3
year 3
warranty 3
I 0
'd 0
paid 0
almost 0
$ 0
400 0
for 0
, 0
and 0
I 0
had 0
to 0
call 0
in 0
, 0
spend 0
hours 0
on 0
their 0
online 3
chat 3
service 3
, 0
and 0
fax 0
in 0
multiple 0
documents 0
. 0
I 0
hate 0
to 0
say 0
this 0
, 0
but 0
if 0
I 0
could 0
take 0
this 0
back 0
to 0
the 0
shop 0
and 0
get 0
my 0
money 0
back 0
, 0
then 0
I 0
would 0
. 0
It 0
makes 0
doing 0
schoolwork 0
at 0
night 0
so 0
much 0
easier 0
. 0
Being 0
only 0
2 0
months 0
old 0
, 0
I 0
am 0
not 0
a 0
happy 0
camper 0
! 0
> 0
iPhoto 1
is 0
probably 0
the 0
best 0
program 0
I 0
have 0
ever 0
worked 0
with 0
: 0
easy 0
and 0
convenient 0
. 0
I 0
love 0
to 0
write 0
and 0
play 0
with 0
graphics 0
and 0
html 0
programming 0
and 0
my 0
new 0
Toshiba 0
works 1
great 0
on 0
both 0
! 0
THis 0
computer 0
may 0
be 0
small 0
but 0
it 0
is 0
one 0
heck 0
of 0
a 0
power 0
horse 0
. 0
They 0
would 0
repair 0
one 0
thing 0
, 0
send 0
it 0
back 0
and 0
it 0
would 0
still 0
have 0
the 0
same 0
problem 0
. 0
Such 0
as 0
PAGES 0
, 0
NUMBERS 0
, 0
and 0
so 0
on 0
. 0
My 0
laptop 0
now 0
has 0
no 0
battery 3
. 0
Beta 0
had 0
better 0
quality 0
, 0
but 0
VHS 0
became 0
the 0
industry 0
standard 0
. 0
It 0
made 0
the 0
computer 0
much 0
easier 0
to 0
use 1
and 0
navigate 1
. 0
Needs 0
longer 0
lasting 0
battery 3
, 0
More 0
than 0
1 0
to 0
2 0
Hrs 0
. 0
in 0
May 0
I 0
started 0
having 0
problems 0
with 0
the 0
USB 3
ports 3
not 0
working 0
. 0
10 0
plus 0
hours 0
of 0
battery 1
. 0
If 0
only 0
Bill 0
Gates 0
would 0
read 0
some 0
of 0
what 0
is 0
said 0
here 0
MS 0
would 0
do 0
a 0
better 0
job 0
. 0
The 0
design 1
is 0
awesome 0
, 0
quality 1
is 0
unprecedented 0
. 0
I 0
'm 0
going 0
to 0
try 0
and 0
keep 0
my 0
old 0
G4 0
on 0
the 0
road 0
for 0
as 0
long 0
as 0
possible 0
. 0
The 0
Mac 1
version 1
of 1
Microsoft 1
Office 1
is 0
cheaper 0
than 0
buying 0
the 0
actual 0
and 0
works 0
just 0
as 0
well 0
. 0
The 0
Mac 0
takes 0
about 0
the 0
same 0
amount 0
of 0
startingup 1
time 1
as 0
the 0
average 0
PC 0
, 0
but 0
keeps 0
itself 0
cleaned 0
up 0
and 0
ready 0
to 0
use 0
. 0
Its 0
hard 0
to 0
encounter 0
a 0
problem 0
on 0
a 0
mac 0
that 0
would 0
require 0
such 0
abrupt 0
action 0
. 0
The 0
Toshiba 0
Net 0
book 0
operates 1
very 0
well 0
. 0
I 0
loved 0
it 0
. 0
It 0
is 0
also 0
very 0
lightweight 0
, 0
making 0
transporting 1
this 0
computer 0
very 0
easy 0
. 0
If 0
anything 0
, 0
I 0
would 0
only 0
suggest 0
using 0
one 0
of 0
these 0
laptops 0
if 0
only 0
you 0
have 0
to 0
. 0
I 0
sit 0
down 0
and 0
use 0
my 0
husband 0
's 0
work 0
PC 0
and 0
I 0
do 0
n't 0
like 0
it 0
one 0
bit 0
. 0
It 0
's 0
wonderful 0
for 0
computer 0
gaming 1
. 0
the 0
place 0
we 0
bought 0
it 0
from 0
said 0
that 0
after 0
they 0
send 0
it 0
out 0
to 0
gateway 0
4 0
times 0
they 0
would 0
give 0
us 0
a 0
new 0
one 0
. 0
it 0
is 0
very 0
easy 0
for 0
anyone 0
to 0
use 1
an 0
apple 0
and 0
specially 0
the 0
mcbook 0
pro 0
notebook 0
. 0
I 0
like 0
it 0
better 0
than 0
my 0
big 0
Dell 0
Laptop 0
. 0
The 0
flaws 0
are 0
, 0
this 0
computer 0
is 0
not 0
for 0
computer 0
gamers 0
because 0
of 0
the 0
OS 3
X 3
. 0
I 0
tried 0
giving 0
it 0
0 0
stars 0
but 0
I 0
had 0
to 0
choose 0
at 0
least 0
one 0
, 0
but 0
IMO 0
NO 0
STARS 0
They 0
really 0
do 0
have 0
the 0
worlds 0
very 0
worst 0
repair 3
service 3
. 0
They 0
need 0
to 0
stop 0
outsoucing 0
and 0
send 0
some 0
complaint 0
calls 0
to 0
US 0
based 0
customer 3
service 3
agents 3
for 0
those 0
who 0
live 0
in 0
the 0
United 0
states 0
. 0
I 0
was 0
also 0
able 0
to 0
install 0
and 0
use 0
my 0
Photoshop 1
and 0
AfterEffects 1
programs 1
easily 0
. 0
for 0
being 0
so 0
small 0
it 0
is 0
amazing 0
that 0
it 0
is 0
as 0
fast 0
as 0
it 0
is 0
. 0
Heck 0
, 0
I 0
like 0
all 0
Mac 0
computers 0
, 0
but 0
they 0
're 0
all 0
WAY 0
too 0
pricey 0
for 0
the 0
kind 0
of 0
economy 0
the 0
U.S. 0
is 0
going 0
through 0
. 0
They 0
claim 0
that 0
I 0
should 0
be 0
happy 0
because 0
I 0
am 0
getting 0
a 0
new 0
laptop 0
to 0
replace 0
my 0
twomonth 0
old 0
laptop 0
. 0
I 0
'm 0
already 0
hooked 0
on 0
the 0
sleek 0
look 1
and 0
dependability 1
that 0
this 0
laptop 0
has 0
shown 0
. 0
The 0
machine 0
itself 0
is 0
alright 0
. 0
It 0
seems 0
to 0
have 0
some 0
opions 0
that 0
are 0
intalled 0
but 0
do 0
not 0
work 0
like 0
I 0
thought 0
they 0
would 0
. 0
And 0
having 0
to 0
deal 0
with 0
the 0
company 3
has 0
been 0
a 0
even 0
worse 0
nightmare 0
. 0
I 0
will 0
definitely 0
be 0
getting 0
a 0
new 0
laptop 0
if 0
it 0
has 0
any 0
more 0
issues 0
after 0
the 0
warranty 2
expires 0
and 0
researching 0
carefully 0
when 0
I 0
do 0
so 0
I 0
do 0
n't 0
run 0
accross 0
a 0
situation 0
like 0
this 0
again 0
! 0
I 0
also 0
experience 0
the 0
same 0
with 0
my 0
MacBook 0
Air 0
. 0
It 0
has 0
all 0
the 0
features 1
that 0
are 0
necessary 0
for 0
college 0
and 0
if 0
not 0
they 0
are 0
able 0
to 0
be 0
added 0
onto 0
the 0
computer 0
. 0
I 0
have 0
owned 0
many 0
different 0
brands 0
of 0
laptops 0
in 0
my 0
life 0
. 0
I 0
did 0
an 0
internet 0
search 0
and 0
this 0
is 0
a 0
very 0
common 0
problem 0
with 0
this 0
laptop 0
. 0
I 0
've 0
owned 0
this 0
labtop 0
for 0
less 0
then 0
two 0
months 0
, 0
already 0
the 0
mouse 3
button 3
has 0
broke 0
. 0
It 0
did 0
fairly 0
well 0
, 0
other 0
than 0
it 0
's 0
poor 0
performance 3
, 0
overheating 0
and 0
occational 0
blue 0
screen 0
. 0
The 0
touchpad 1
is 0
very 0
intuitive 0
, 0
so 0
much 0
so 0
that 0
I 0
never 0
want 0
to 0
use 0
buttons 2
to 0
click 0
again 0
! 0
tons 0
of 0
bloatware 0
and 0
junk 0
programs 3
. 0
its 0
sad 0
because 0
their 0
commercials 0
are 0
great 0
. 0
lots 0
of 0
extra 0
space 1
but 0
the 0
keyboard 3
is 0
ridiculously 0
small 0
. 0
Luckily 0
, 0
Dell 0
said 0
they 0
would 0
replace 0
my 0
laptop 0
with 0
a 0
new 0
one 0
, 0
but 0
instead 0
I 0
got 0
a 0
refund 0
and 0
bought 0
a 0
mac 0
. 0
I 0
decided 0
to 0
get 0
this 0
pile 0
of 0
crap 0
on 0
a 0
whim 0
and 0
totally 0
freaking 0
regret 0
it 0
. 0
Never 0
been 0
hacked 0
. 0
Good 0
keyboard 1
, 0
long 0
battery 1
life 1
, 0
largest 0
hard 1
drive 1
and 0
windows 1
7 1
. 0
I 0
think 0
it 0
was 0
seventy 0
nine 0
plus 0
tax 0
. 0
In 0
summary 0
, 0
take 0
your 0
money 0
elsewhere 0
. 0
The 0
processor 1
is 0
very 0
quick 0
and 0
effective 0
as 0
I 0
load 1
webpages 2
and 0
applications 2
. 0
My 0
battery 3
went 0
bad 0
about 0
a 0
year 0
and 0
a 0
half 0
after 0
having 0
it 0
and 0
it 0
cost 0
around 0
eighty 0
to 0
a 0
hundred 0
dollars 0
! 0
I 0
will 0
NEVER 0
buy 0
Refurbished 0
again 0
, 0
I 0
do 0
n't 0
cae 0
how 0
cheap 0
it 0
is 0
. 0
It 0
pretty 0
much 0
does 0
everything 0
we 0
could 0
ever 0
need 0
, 0
and 0
looks 0
great 0
to 0
boot 1
. 0
Bottom 0
line 0
, 0
I 0
doubt 0
you 0
'd 0
be 0
overly 0
disappointed 0
if 0
you 0
invest 0
in 0
this 0
machine 0
. 0
As 0
a 0
lifelong 0
Windows 3
user 0
, 0
I 0
was 0
extremely 0
pleased 0
to 0
make 0
the 0
change 0
to 0
Mac 0
. 0
So 0
, 0
owing 0
to 0
these 0
problems 0
, 0
I 0
went 0
out 0
and 0
got 0
myself 0
an 0
Apple 0
MacBook 0
Pro 0
, 0
which 0
I 0
am 0
using 0
with 0
great 0
satisfaction 0
at 0
this 0
very 0
moment 0
. 0
The 0
Macbook 0
Pro 0
is 0
extremely 0
thin 0
and 0
light 0
compared 0
to 0
those 0
heavy 0
Windows 0
Laptop 0
. 0
So 0
this 0
was 0
great 0
for 0
me 0
. 0
This 0
is 0
the 0
first 0
macbook 0
I 0
have 0
ever 0
had 0
. 0
The 0
acer 0
one 0
compuer 0
is 0
a 0
great 0
computer 0
. 0
another 0
problem 0
. 0
The 0
Macbook 0
is 0
also 0
made 0
better 0
, 0
my 0
computer 0
has 0
never 0
got 0
a 0
virus 0
, 0
and 0
the 0
laptop 0
runs 1
just 0
as 0
fast 0
as 0
the 0
first 0
day 0
I 0
bought 0
it 0
. 0
I 0
picked 0
it 0
out 0
because 0
it 0
was 0
inexpensive 0
$ 0
400 0
and 0
I 0
thought 0
it 0
would 0
be 0
a 0
good 0
, 0
easy 0
to 0
use 1
first 0
laptop 0
. 0
The 0
Time 0
remaining 0
goes 0
from 0
4 0
hours 0
plus 0
to 0
less 0
than 0
2 0
hours 0
over 0
the 0
span 0
of 0
about 0
10 0
minutes 0
. 0
Pay 0
attention 0
to 0
the 0
specs 2
if 0
you 0
want 0
these 0
options 0
. 0
It 0
also 0
does 0
not 0
have 0
bluetooth 3

Being 0

whole 0

The 0
real 0
stand 0
out 0
on 0
this 0
computer 0
is 0
the 0
feel 0
of 0
the 0
keyboard 1
and 0
it 0
's 0
speed 1
. 0
Delivery 1
was 0
early 0
too 0
. 0
During 0
that 0
time 0
, 0
I 0
had 0
to 0
send 0
it 0
back 0
3 0
times 0
. 0
Although 0
I 0
opted 0
for 0
the 0
lowest 0
end 0
MacBook 0
Pro 0
, 0
this 0
thing 0
holds 0
its 0
own 0
. 0
And 0
that 0
probably 0
explains 0
why 0
I 0
've 0
already 0
had 0
my 0
SATA 3
controller 3
go 0
bad 0
within 0
a 0
year 0
of 0
buying 0
it 0

I 0
my 0

also 0
now 0
the 0
proud 0
owner 0
of 0
a 0
Macbook 0

well 0
! 0
I 0
've 0
had 0
a 0
Toshiba 0
laptop 0
in 0
the 0
past 0
; 0
It 0
's 0
also 0
very 0
capable 0
of 0
doing 0
moderate 0
video 1
editing 1
although 0
you 0
may 0
need 0
the 0

said 0
my 0
netbook 0
was 0
working 0
properly 0
. 0
I 0
received 0
this 0
laptop 0
as 0
a 0
gift 0
and 0
let 0
me 0
just 0
tell 0
you 0
that 0
its 0
the 0
worst 0
. 0
Very 0
annoying 0
. 0
My 0
main 0
reason 0
to 0
convert 0
was 0
the 0
imovie 1
program 1
. 0
It 0
has 0
a 0
faster 0
processor 1

more 0

If 0
you 0
need 0
an 0
affordable 0

Laptops 0
are 0
usually 0
used 0
on 0
the 0
go 0
, 0
so 0
why 0
not 0
give 0
you 0
a 0
better 0
battery 3
? 0
I 0
will 0
never 0
complain 0
about 0
the 0
price 0
since 0
I 0
believe 0
you 0
get 0
what 0
you 0
pay 0
for 0
and 0
my 0
MacBook 0
Pro 0
was 0
worth 0
every 0
dollar 0
. 0
I 0
was 0
n't 0
a 0
big 0
fan 0
of 0
the 0
Netbooks 0
but 0
this 0
one 0
was 0
very 0
well 0
designed 1
. 0
It 0
may 0
take 0
a 0
little 0
getting 0
used 0
to 0
but 0
you 0
do 0
n't 0
have 0
to 0
worry 0
about 0
viruses 0
or 0
other 0
headaches 0
. 0
And 0
the 0
warranty 1
on 0
this 0
macbook 0
pro 0
can 0
last 0
up 0
to 0
5 0
years 0
or 0
1000 0
battery 0
recharge 0
cycles 0
. 0
I 0
still 0
have 0
that 0
stupid 0
bluetooth 3
mouse 3
to 0
! 0
Would 0
like 0
more 0
trendy 0
, 0
high 0
tech 0
features 3
. 0
Keyboard 1
is 0
great 0
but 0
primary 0
and 0
secondary 0
control 3
buttons 3
could 0
be 0
more 0
durable 0
. 0
Screen 0
is 0
a 0
bit 0
glossy 0
, 0
but 0
that 0
's 0
not 0
too 0
bad 0
. 0
Received 0
the 0
product 0
promptly 0
and 0
without 0
any 0
issues 0
. 0
I 0
remind 0
myself 0
from 0
time 0
to 0
time 0
to 0
take 0
off 0
my 0
watch 0
when 0
ever 0
I 0
look 0
at 0
the 0
small 0
scratch 0
that 0
it 0
has 0
caused 0
. 0
I 0
got 0
it 0
back 0
again 0
and 0
was 0
told 0
the 0
motherboard 3
had 0
been 0
replaced 0
, 0
so 0
I 0
was 0
now 0
on 0
the 0
SECOND 0
motherboard 3
within 0
3 0
months 0
. 0
But 0
reasons 0
we 0
chose 0
this 0
Apple 0
computer 0
. 0
They 0
say 0
it 0
could 0
be 0
the 0
motherboard 3
again 0
, 0
but 0
Dell 0
I 0
upgraded 0
from 0
a 0
5 0
year 0
old 0
laptop 0
and 0
was 0
amazed 0
to 0
find 0
out 0
that 0
this 0
computer 0
is 0
much 0
slower 0
then 0
my 0
old 0
laptop 0
. 0
2nd 0
Best 0
computer 0
in 0
the 0
world 0
only 0
one 0
way 0
this 0
computer 0
might 0
become 0
the 0
best 0
is 0
that 0
it 0
needs 0
to 0
upgreade 0
patches 3
to 0
make 0
less 0
easier 0
for 0
people 0
to 0
hack 0
into 0
Love 0
the 0
speed 1
, 0
especially 0
! 0
It 0
could 0
be 0
a 0
perfect 0
laptop 0
if 0
it 0
would 0
have 0
faster 0
system 3
memory 3
and 0
its 0
radeon 3
5850 3
would 0
have 0
DDR5 1
instead 0
of 0
DDR3 3
. 0
Not 0
only 0
are 0
the 0
versions 0
of 0
these 0
programs 1
able 0
to 0
be 0
saved 0
, 0
worked 0
on 0
and 0
opened 0
on 0
both 0
a 0
PC 0
and 0
Mac 0
, 0
the 0
versions 0
of 0
these 0
programs 1
on 0
a 0
Mac 0
are 0
graphically 0
and 0
functionally 0
superior 0
. 0
By 0
Air 0
sounds 0
more 0
like 0
by 0
truck 0
to 0
Me 0
. 0
So 0
far 0
it 0
has 0
been 0
five 0
months 0
since 0
the 0
last 0
problem 0
was 0
fixed 0
and 0
I 0
am 0
PRAYING 0
it 0
has 0
finally 0
stopped 0
. 0
It 0
's 0
outstanding 0
too 0
. 0
The 0
speed 1
gives 0
you 0
the 0
power 0
to 0
work 0
on 0
these 0
projects 0
seamlessly 0
, 0
and 0
multiple 0
at 0
a 0
time 0
if 0
you 0
sowish 0
. 0
Awesome 0
laptop 0
and 0
the 0
perfect 0
size 1
to 0
carry 0
around 0
in 0
college 0
. 0
So 0
I 0
'm 0
disappointed 0
in 0
that 0
because 0
communicating 0
with 0
my 0
relatives 0
out 0
of 0
the 0
area 0
is 0
a 0
priority 0
. 0
A 0
MONTH 0
LATER 0
, 0
we 0
reinstall 0
the 0
OS 3
Vista 3
. 0
Some 0
problems 0
can 0
be 0
fixed 0
if 0
you 0
purchase 0
new 0
software 3
, 0
but 0
there 0
is 0
no 0
guarentee 0
. 0
just 0
chill 0
and 0
enjoy 0
. 0
The 0
battery 1
life 1
is 0
also 0
relatively 0
good 0
. 0
It 0
is 0
her 0
first 0
laptop 0
and 0
she 0
is 0
thrilled 0
. 0
I 0
should 0
have 0
sent 0
it 0
back 0
to 0
them 0
then 0
. 0
I 0
definitely 0
suggest 0
getting 0
an 0
extended 1
warranty 1
, 0
you 0
will 0
probably 0
need 0
it 0
! 0
If 0
this 0
would 0
be 0
your 0
first 0
Mac 0
purchase 0
then 0
I 0
would 0
highly 0
suggest 0
that 0
you 0
take 0
advantage 0
of 0
the 0
class 0
that 0
they 0
offer 0
to 0
learn 0
about 0
the 0
differences 0
between 0
Mac 0
and 0
PC 0
's 0
. 0
This 0
laptop 0
leaves 0
alot 0
to 0
be 0
desired 0
, 0
I 0
have 0
had 0
it 0
only 0
5 0
months 0
and 0
have 0
had 0
to 0
send 0
it 0
away 0
to 0
be 0
repaired 0
twice 0
. 0
I 0
have 0
found 0
it 0
very 0
easy 0
to 0
use 1
, 0
very 0
imformative 0
, 0
wonder 0
alerts 0
and 0
tutorials 0
making 0
it 0
very 0
easy 0
for 0
someone 0
like 0
me 0
who 0
is 0
not 0
exactly 0
technologically 0
advanced 0
to 0
learn 0
to 0
use 1
the 0
various 0
features 1
and 0
programs 1
. 0
I 0
do 0
n't 0
have 0
stupid 0
pop 1
up 1
windows 1
even 0
when 0
I 0
have 0
pop 2
ups 2
blocked 0
, 0
I 0
do 0
n't 0
have 0
to 0
wait 0
5 0
minutes 0
for 0
a 0
webpage 0
to 0
download 0
, 0
and 0
best 0
of 0
all 0
I 0
can 0
run 0
all 0
the 0
web 1
programming 1
software 1
I 0
need 0
to 0
use 0
all 0
at 0
once 0
without 0
slowing 0
me 0
down 0
. 0
I 0
bought 0
this 0
laptop 0
so 0
that 0
the 0
entire 0
family 0
had 0
a 0
computer 0
in 0
the 0
living 0
room 0
; 0
Do 0
n't 0
waste 0
your 0
money 0
or 0
time 0
. 0
It 0
has 0
spent 0
more 0
time 0
in 0
repair 0
shops 0
than 0
i 0
can 0
possibly 0
recount 0
here 0
. 0
Memory 1
is 0
upgradable 0
. 0
Web 3
access 3
through 0
the 0
3G 3
network 3
is 0
so 0
slow 0
, 0
it 0
's 0
very 0
frustrating 0
and 0
VERY 0
DISAPPOINTING 0
. 0
Well 0
, 0
I 0
bought 0
this 0
laptop 0
a 0
month 0
or 0
two 0
ago 0
. 0
My 0
MacBook 0
Pro 0
has 0
been 0
a 0
huge 0
disappointment 0
. 0
Received 0
all 0
four 0
in 0
good 0
order 0
; 0
The 0
computer 0
first 0
started 0
malfunctioning 0
3 0
months 0
after 0
purchasing 0
it 0
. 0
this 0
is 0
starting 0
off 0
good 0
. 0
The 0
large 0
screen 1
also 0
helps 0
when 0
you 0
are 0
working 0
in 0
design 2
based 2
programs 2
like 0
Adobe 2
Creative 2
Suite 2
. 0
The 0
only 0
pro 0
to 0
this 0
computer 0
is 0
it 0
was 0
under 0
$ 0
600 0
! 0
Moral 0
of 0
the 0
story 0
: 0
Do 0
not 0
buy 0
anything 0
from 0
companies 3
that 0
do 0
not 0
respect 0
their 0
customers 0
. 0
This 0
is 0
my 0
first 0
Dell 0
I 0
heard 0
their 0
customer 3
service 3
was 0
lacking 0
and 0
that 0
they 0
were 0
working 0
on 0
improving 0
it 0
! 0
As 0
well 0
as 0
having 0
the 0
plug 3
in 0
the 0
computer 0
come 0
loose 0
. 0
Very 0
small 0
and 0
portable 0
I 0
've 0
had 0
this 0
netbook 0
about 0
12 0
hrs 0
now 0
and 0
It 0
's 0
better 0
than 0
expected 0
. 0
NOT 0
WITH 0
APPLE 0
. 0
After 0
3 0
pleasant 0
weeks 0
of 0
use 0
, 0
the 0
laptop 0
just 0
died 0
. 0
Each 0
time 0
taking 0
about 0
1 0
day 0
or 0
so 0
. 0
Second 0
HDD 2
cover 2
has 0
walls 0
inside 0
that 0
need 0
to 0
be 0
broken 0
if 0
you 0
what 0
to 0
install 0
one 0
. 0
If 0
you 0
want 0
more 0
information 0
on 0
macs 0
I 0
suggest 0
going 0
to 0
apple.com 0
and 0
heading 0
towards 0
the 0
macbook 0
page 0
for 0
more 0
information 0
on 0
the 0
applications 2
. 0
So 0
a 0
couple 0
of 0
years 0
later 0
, 0
I 0
was 0
a 0
dumb 0
college 0
girl 0
and 0
had 0
to 0
have 0
the 0
wireless 0
internet 0
. 0
This 0
netbook 0
went 0
bad 0
on 0
me 0
after 0
3 0
days 0
. 0
Probably 0
wo 0
n't 0
work 0
either 0
. 0
Great 0
product 0
by 0
Apple 0
with 0
the 0
new 0
great 0
looking 0
design 1
. 0
I 0
love 0
the 0
keyboard 1
. 0
Probably 0
as 0
good 0
as 0
you 0
can 0
get 0
in 0
a 0
netbook 0
, 0
does 0
everything 0
I 0
ask 0
for 0
and 0
has 0
some 0
very 0
good 0
unexpected 0
pluses 0
. 0
Overall 0
I 0
am 0
very 0
satisfied 0
with 0
the 0
purchase 0
. 0
In 0
my 0
line 0
of 0
work 0
, 0
I 0
often 0
have 0
to 0
take 0
work 0
home 0
, 0
and 0
this 0
makes 0
it 0
so 0
easy 0
. 0
They 0
told 0
me 0
to 0
reprogram 0
the 0
computer 0
, 0
and 0
I 0
did 0
n't 0
need 0
to 0
do 0
that 0
, 0
and 0
I 0
lost 0
pictures 0
of 0
my 0
oldests 0
first 0
2 0
years 0
of 0
her 0
life 0
. 0
I 0
bought 0
this 0
laptop 0
for 0
my 0
son 0
in 0
2007 0
for 0
his 0
Christmas 0
present 0
. 0
It 0
took 0
so 0
much 0
time 0
. 0
The 0
screen 0
is 0
n't 0
huge 0
, 0
but 0
that 0
does 0
n't 0
matter 0
when 0
I 0
output 0
media 0
to 0
the 0
50 0
inch 0

will 0
have 0
to 0

You 0
will 0

For 0
the 0

my 0

Setting 3

for 0
some 0

the 0

some 0

that 0
completely 0
shut 0
the 0
computer 0
down 0
when 0

Ever 0
since 0
I 0
bought 0
this 0
laptop 0
, 0
so 0
far 0
I 0
've 0
experience 0
nothing 0

constant 0

No 0
laptop 0
is 0
perfect 0
, 0
but 0
sometimes 0
you 0
just 0
find 0
a 0
computer 0
that 0
works 0
for 0
you 0
. 0
Also 0
, 0
the 0
space 3

makes 0
a 0
noisy 0

every 0

iPhotos 1
is 0
an 0
excellent 0
program 1
for 0
storing 0
and 0
organizing 0
photos 0
. 0
Other 0
than 0
that 0
its 0
a 0
great 0
performing 1
machine 0
and 0
well 0
meets 0
all 0
my 0
needs 0
and 0
more 0
. 0
We 0
were 0
occasional 0
Mac 0
users 0
before 0
, 0
but 0
most 0
recently 0
owned 0
a 0
budget 0
PC 0
since 0
it 0
is 0
what 0
we 0
could 0
afford 0
. 0
I 0
would 0
never 0
tell 0
anyone 0
to 0
buy 0
one 0
either 0
. 0
The 0
programs 1
are 0
great 0
, 0
like 0
iphoto 1
love 0
the 0
editing 0
capabilities 0
, 0
imail 1
which 0
can 0
incorporate 0
with 0
the 0
address 0
book 0
on 0
the 0
ipod 0
and 0
ipad 0
, 0
imovie 1
, 0
etc 0
. 0
The 0
only 0
thing 0
I 0
did 0
n't 0
learn 0
in 0
my 0
research 0
was 0
the 0
software 2
I 0
would 0
need 0
like 0
privacy 0
protection 0
and 0
warranty 0
protection 0
, 0
in 0
case 0
it 0
gets 0
broken 0
, 0
or 0
crashes 0
etc 0
. 0
I 0
ca 0
n't 0
say 0
enough 0
good 0
for 0
it 0
! 0
Comfterbale 0
to 0
use 1
light 0
easy 0
to 0
transport 1
. 0
The 0
Computer 0
itself 0
is 0
a 0
good 0
product 0
but 0
the 0
repair 3
depot 3
stinks 0
. 0
I 0
was 0
tired 0
of 0
going 0
without 0
my 0
laptop 0
every 0
few 0
weeks 0
. 0
the 0
only 0
down 0
fall 0
is 0
that 0
it 0
has 0
no 0
cd 3
drive 3
but 0
i 0
found 0
that 0
they 0
are 0
very 0
cheap 0
to 0
by 0
and 0
also 0
very 0
portable 0
making 0
this 0
the 0
best 0
friend 0
to 0
someone 0
who 0
is 0
always 0
looking 0
for 0
more 0
space 0
then 0
they 0
have 0
. 0
So 0
, 0
the 0
hard 2
disk 2
capacity 2
really 0
does 0
n't 0
matter 0
to 0
me 0
. 0
Keys 3
stick 0
periodically 0
and 0
I 0
havent 0
had 0
the 0
laptop 0
for 0
45 0
days 0
yet 0
. 0
It 0
crashes 0
, 0
and 0
when 0
it 0
goes 0
flat 0
, 0
it 0
just 0
DIES 0
like 0
a 0
PC 0
, 0
maybe 0
worse 0
and 0
I 0
loose 0
all 0
my 0
open 0
documents 0
! 0
I 0
also 0
like 0
that 0
you 0
can 0
scroll 0
down 0
in 0
a 0
window 0
using 0
two 0
fingers 0
on 0
the 0
trackpad 1
. 0
Everything 0
from 0
the 0
design 1
to 0
the 0
OS 1
is 0
simple 0
and 0
to 0
the 0
point 0
. 0
I 0
am 0
now 0
making 0
a 0
point 0
to 0
avoid 0
their 0
products 0
and 0
I 0
hope 0
my 0
experience 0
can 0
serve 0
as 0
a 0
warning 0
to 0
you 0
as 0
well 0
. 0
I 0
personally 0
like 0
the 0
gaming 1
look 1
but 0
needed 0
a 0
machine 0
that 0
delivered 0
gaming 1
performance 1
while 0
still 0
looking 0
professional 0
in 0
front 0
of 0
my 0
customers 0
. 0
When 0
you 0
look 0
at 0
the 0
specs 0
on 0
Apple 0
products 0
in 0
comparison 0
to 0
a 0
Dell 0
or 0
a 0
HP 0
, 0
yes 0
they 0
do 0
seem 0
to 0
offer 0
less 0
for 0
a 0
higher 0
cost 3
. 0
Then 0
I 0
proceed 0
to 0
tell 0
her 0
that 0
I 0
checked 0
out 0
other 0
retail 0
stores 0
that 0
carry 0
the 0
netbook 0
and 0
it 0
was 0
n't 0
LIKE 0
THAT 0
. 0
Then 0
they 0
had 0
me 0
jump 0
through 0
many 0
hoops 0
and 0
questions 0
to 0
see 0
if 0
they 0
could 0
find 0
another 0
way 0
to 0
invalidate 0
me 0
. 0
The 0
only 0
downfall 0
is 0
the 0
volume 3
control 3
. 0
Clearly 0
, 0
there 0
is 0
something 0
wrong 0
with 0
the 0
product 0
and 0
LG 0
did 0
n't 0
take 0
up 0
the 0
responsibility 0
. 0
Very 0
fast 0
boot 1
up 1
and 0
shut 1
down 1
. 0
Right 0
out 0
of 0
the 0
box 0
, 0
this 0
little 0
netbook 0
did 0
everything 0
I 0
asked 0
of 0
it 0
, 0
including 0
streaming 0
the 0
everyday 0
video 0
you 0
're 0
bound 0
to 0
encounter 0
checking 0
mail 0
and 0
websites 0
my 0
biggest 0
complaint 0
previously 0
. 0
I 0
am 0
very 0
happy 0
with 0
this 0
laptop 0
. 0
this 0
laptop 0
is 0
durable 0
and 0
it 0
is 0
easy 0
to 0
travel 0
with 0
. 0
I 0
finally 0
decided 0
on 0
this 0
laptop 0
because 0
it 0
was 0
the 0
right 0
price 1
for 0
what 0
I 0
need 0
it 0
. 0
What 0
a 0
mistake 0
! 0
If 0
internet 2
connectivity 2
is 0
important 0
I 0
would 0
recommend 0
going 0
with 0
a 0
dell 0
net 0
book 0
for 0
50 0
bucks 0
more 0
, 0
or 0
buy 0
a 0
USB 2
wireless 2
card 2
. 0
I 0
had 0
read 0
online 0
that 0
some 0
users 0
were 0
having 0
sound 3
problems 0
. 0
My 0
last 0
computer 0
, 0
a 0
Toshiba 0
, 0
cost 1
only 0
$ 0
400 0
, 0
and 0
worked 0
like 0
a 0
charm 0
for 0
many 0
years 0
. 0
It 0
discharges 3
too 0
quickly 0
. 0
But 0
to 0
be 0
honest 0
, 0
the 0
compatibility 3
issues 0
and 0
the 0
other 0
little 0
quirks 0
make 0
me 0
think 0
I 0
ll 0
buy 0
a 0
PC 0
next 0
time 0
. 0
three 0
years 0
is 0
a 0
decent 0
life 0
, 0
but 0
this 0
must 0
make 0
it 0
to 0
graduation 0
and 0
beyond 0
. 0
I 0
work 0
on 0
a 0
PC 0
at 0
home 0
and 0
have 0
used 0
Pc 0
all 0
through 0
college 0
. 0
TOSHIBA 0
WILL 0
NOT 0
ACKNOWLEDGE 0
THIS 0
PROBLEM 0
. 0
Then 0
it 0
ceased 0
charging 3
at 0
all 0
. 0
An 0
absolutely 0
hateful 0
machine 0
that 0
no 0
one 0
should 0
get 0
of 0
their 0
own 0
free 0
will 0
. 0
I 0
am 0
not 0
much 0
of 0
a 0
computer 0
techie 0
, 0
so 0
I 0
can 0
understand 0
some 0
of 0
the 0
internal 0
problems 0
, 0
though 0
I 0
do 0
have 0
trend 2
micro 2
as 0
an 0
antiviral 2
program 2
. 0
Stay 0
away 0
from 0
HP 0
. 0
The 0
computer 0
continued 0
to 0
give 0
me 0
issues 0
and 0
in 0
Late 0
June 0
it 0
completely 0
died 0
again 0
and 0
I 0
tried 0
to 0
call 0
Acer 0
again 0
to 0
get 0
it 0
fixed 0
and 0
they 0
refused 0
to 0
help 0
me 0
, 0
they 0
said 0
my 0
warrenty 3
was 0
up 0
and 0
hung 0
up 0
on 0
me 0
. 0
I 0
've 0
have 0
n't 0
had 0
any 0
major 0
problems 0
with 0
the 0
laptop 0
except 0
that 0
the 0
plastic 3
piece 3
that 0
covers 0
the 0
usb 2
port 2
wires 2
have 0
all 0
come 0
off 0
. 0
Wonderful 0
sleek 0
case 1
design 1
is 0
only 0
on 0
the 0
outside 0
. 0
It 0
is 0
speedy 0
when 0
connected 0
wirelessly 0
to 0
any 0
network 0
regardless 0
if 0
the 0
connection 2
is 0
weak 0
or 0
not 0
. 0
I 0
like 0
it 0
! 0
The 0
pricing 1
is 0
very 0
competitive 0
. 0
so 0
we 0
got 0
a 0
good 0
deal 0
on 0
hsn 0
for 0
an 0
ascer 0
notebook 0
and 0
we 0
bought 0
it 0
for 0
him 0
. 0
Connecting 0
to 0
my 0
wireless 0
router 0
via 0
builtin 1
wireless 1
took 0
no 0
time 0
at 0
all 0
. 0
Its 0
still 0
going 0
. 0
This 0
computer 0
is 0
exceptionally 0
thin 0
for 0
it 0
's 0
screen 1
size 1
and 0
processing 1
power 1
. 0
I 0
have 0
not 0
had 0
a 0
problem 0
with 0
the 0
applications 1
quitting 0
or 0
freezing 0
. 0
Prior 0
to 0
this 0
computer 0
, 0
I 0
owned 0
a 0
PowerBook 0
G4 0
for 0
6 0
years 0
quite 0
a 0
long 0
time 0
for 0
a 0
laptop 0
. 0
The 0
advantages 0
of 0
owning 0
a 0
mac 0
are 0
numerous 0
. 0
I 0
challenge 0
anyone 0
to 0
show 0
proof 0
that 0
through 0
anywhere 0
near 0
normal 0
use 0
can 0
get 0
more 0
than 0
2.5 0
hrs 0
out 0
of 0
it 0
. 0
This 0
wiped 0
out 0
several 0
programs 3
that 0
were 0
installed 0
on 0
the 0
computer 0
when 0
it 0
was 0
bought 0
. 0
On 0
the 0
twelfth 0
day 0
that 0
I 0
had 0
the 0
notebook 0
, 0
I 0
decided 0
to 0
go 0
to 0
Dell 0
's 0
website 0
and 0
update 0
it 0
. 0
The 0
computer 0
blinks 0
it 0
shuts 0
off 0
at 0
will 0
. 0
Excellent 0
product 0
for 0
the 0
money 0
. 0
It 0
's 0
graphics 1
are 0
n't 0
bad 0
at 0
all 0
, 0
for 0
the 0
lower 0
end 0
of 0
the 0
MacBook 0
Pro 0
spectrum 0
, 0
easily 0
capable 0
of 0
running 0
StarCraft 0
II 0
and 0
other 0
games 0
with 0
comparable 0
graphics 1
. 0
I 0
have 0
Vista 3
, 0
so 0
I 0
am 0
unable 0
to 0
install 3
and 0
uninstall 0
some 0
programs 3
. 0
The 0
screen 1
is 0
bright 0
and 0
vivid 0
and 0
the 0
keyboard 1
is 0
very 0
easy 0
to 0
use 0
, 0
very 0
important 0
for 0
use 0
quick 0
typers 0
. 0
I 0
can 0
do 0
everything 0
I 0
could 0
before 0
, 0
only 0
faster 0
and 0
more 0
efficiently 0
. 0
I 0
called 0
Toshiba 0
and 0
they 0
want 0
me 0
to 0
be 0
without 0
my 0
laptop 0
for 0
about 0
two 0
weeks 0
while 0
they 0
look 0
at 0
the 0
problem 0
. 0
For 0
those 0
that 0
care 0
about 0
noise 1
this 0
thing 0
does 0
n't 0
really 0
make 0
any 0
; 0
Here 0
we 0
are 0
another 0
year 0
later 0
and 0
the 0
computer 0
is 0
doing 0
the 0
same 0
thing 0
. 0
Despite 0
the 0
plethora 0
of 0
problems 0
, 0
I 0
managed 0
to 0
use 0
technological 0
trickery 0
to 0
keep 0
the 0
machine 0
operational 0
for 0
two 0
years 0
. 0
I 0
had 0
my 0
IWORKS 1
, 0
Itunes 1
, 0
Email 0
, 0
MS 1
Office 1
, 0
network 0
and 0
printers 0
set 0
up 0
and 0
completely 0
working 0
perfectly 0
within 0
an 0
hour 0
. 0
Simply 0
amazing 0
computer 0
! 0
! 0
I 0
first 0
purchased 0
this 0
Dell 0
model 0
1764 0
on 0
April 0
6 0
, 0
201 0
The 0
macbooks 0
are 0
small 0
enough 0
to 0
be 0
very 0
portable 0
yet 0
hold 0
tons 0
of 0
information 0
and 0
performance 1
. 0
Two 0
times 0
with 0
in 0
one 0
month 0
. 0
The 0
only 0
downfall 0
is 0
a 0
lot 0
of 0
the 0
software 3
I 0
have 0
wo 0
n't 0
work 0
with 0
Mac 0
and 0
iWork 3
is 0
not 0
worth 0
the 0
price 3
of 0
it 0
. 0
Waited 0
on 0
getting 0
this 0
computer 0
, 0
but 0
it 0
has 0
been 0
a 0
great 0
change 0
. 0
For 0
my 0
burn 0
thigh 0
which 0
has 0
put 0
a 0
permanent 0
mark 0
on 0
my 0
skin 0
it 0
happened 0
7 0
months 0
ago 0
they 0
offered 0
me 0
an 0
ITouch 0
8Gig 0
you 0
know 0
it 0
is 0
a 0
bit 0
insulating 0
when 0
a 0
company 0
this 0
rich 0
, 0
offer 0
a 0
loyal 0
customer 0
like 0
me 0
, 0
a 0
bottom 0
of 0
their 0
product 0
line 0
as 0
a 0
gift 0
for 0
events 0
like 0
this 0
. 0
BUT 0
there 0
's 0
this 0
application 2
called 0
Boot 2
Camp 2
which 0
allows 0
you 0
to 0
add 0
another 0
OS 2
X 2
like 0
Windows 2
. 0
The 0
mousepad 3
is 0
a 0
huge 0
pain 0
in 0
the 0
arse 0
! 0
I 0
hope 0
to 0
edit 0
this 0
in 0
the 0
next 0
few 0
hours 0
, 0
I 0
am 0
going 0
to 0
try 0
to 0
install 0
my 0
own 0
copy 0
of 0

If 0
it 0

not 0

next 0
step 0
. 0
I 0
also 0
purchased 0
Applecare 2
for 0
$ 0
300 0
, 0
which 0
is 0
a 0
three 0
year 0
extended 2
warranty 2
, 0
since 0
I 0
ve 0
never 0
seen 0
any 0
laptop 0
that 0
lasted 0
more 0
than 0
two 0
. 0
I 0
have 0
had 0
the 0
netbook 0
for 0
2 0
months 0
and 0
I 0
love 0
it 0
, 0
I 0
read 0
some 0
reviews 0
that 0
say 0
netbooks 0
are 0
slow 0
but 0
it 0
does 0
not 0
seem 0
any 0
slower 0
than 0
the 0
other 0
computers 0
I 0
use 0
. 0
C'mon 0
, 0
LG 0
. 0
Whenever 0
I 0
call 0
Dell 0
about 0
an 0
unrelated 0
problem 0
, 0
they 0
ask 0
me 0
if 0
my 0
laptop 0
is 0
running 0
slowly 0
and 0
if 0
I 0
'd 0
like 0
to 0
purchase 0
more 0
memory 2
for 0
$ 0
75 0
. 0
since 0
then 0
i 0
have 0
had 0
minor 0
problems 0
with 0
slow 0
operation 3
. 0
If 0
you 0
faintly 0
come 0
close 0
to 0
touching 0
this 0
thing 0
while 0
typing 0
, 0
all 0
craziness 0
may 0
break 0
loose 0
. 0
Finally 0
was 0
able 0
to 0
reach 0
a 0
young 0
lady 0
in 0
California 0
and 0
ordered 0
the 0
machine 0
and 0
was 0
subsequently 0
given 0
a 0
delivery 0
date 0
. 0
I 0
definitely 0
will 0
buy 0
a 0
Mac 0
again 0
if 0
and 0
when 0
this 0
computer 0
ever 0
fails 0
. 0
The 0

a 0
great 0
little 0
computer 0
. 0
Take 0
your 0
time 0
and 0
go 0
through 0
the 0
tutorials 2
patiently 0
. 0
So 0
if 0
anyones 0
looking 0
to 0
buy 0
a 0
computer 0
or 0
laptop 0
you 0
should 0
stay 0
far 0
far 0
away 0
from 0
any 0
that 0
have 0
the 0
name 0
TOSHIBA 0
on 0
it 0
. 0
I 0
'm 0
an 0
excellent 0
touch 0
typist 0
, 0
and 0
my 0
hands 0
are 0
very 0
sensitive 0
, 0
too 0
. 0
This 0
time 0
the 0
mouse 3
pad 3
and 0
right 3
click 3
key 3
would 0
n't 0
work 0
! 0
EVENTUALLY 0
we 0
pushed 0
hard 0
enough 0
to 0
convince 0
them 0
that 0
this 0
was 0
the 0
MACHINE 0
that 0
was 0
causing 0
the 0
problems 0
. 0
The 0
first 0
full 3
charge 3
of 0
this 0
battery 3
got 0
me 0
only 0
about 0
2 0
full 0
hours 0
. 0
I 0
bought 0
a 0
cordless 1
mouse 1
for 0
it 0
, 0
but 0
do 0
n't 0
always 0
take 0
it 0
out 0
; 0
When 0
I 0
got 0
it 0
, 0
I 0
immediately 0
noticed 0
that 0
it 0
was 0
quite 0
heavy 0
and 0
thick 0
and 0
not 0
really 0
attractive 0
. 0
It 0
is 0
sleek 0
, 0
smooth 0
, 0
and 0
lightweight 0
. 0
i 0
am 0
a 0
huge 0
computer 0
person 0
i 0
love 0
anykind 0
of 0
computer 0
that 0
works 0
well 0
, 0
but 0
when 0
i 0
got 0
this 0
one 0
i 0
was 0
so 0
happy 0
with 0
the 0
way 0
it 0
works 0
and 0
how 0
it 0
runs 1
its 0
amazing 0
. 0
They 0
only 0
stay 0
charged 3
a 0
little 0
over 0
an 0
hour 0
. 0
Now 0
they 0
are 0
believers 0
in 0
the 0
product 0
. 0
Had 0
to 0
have 0
this 0
computer 0
repaired 0
twice 0
in 0
the 0
first 0
5 0
months 0
after 0
purchasing 0
it 0
. 0
Hewlett 0
Packard 0
HP 0
Pavillion 0
DV6000 0
Laptop 0
is 0
the 0
worst 0
laptop 0
we 0
have 0
ever 0
bought 0
. 0
I 0
had 0
never 0
owned 0
a 0
Mac 0
before 0
; 0
I 0
could 0
not 0
find 0
a 0
phone 0
number 0
anywhere 0
to 0
call 0
an 0
actual 0
live 0
person 0
for 0
tech 3

and 0
had 0
to 0
result 0
the 0
their 0
online 2

try 0
to 0
use 0
it 0
today 0
and 0
I 0
ca 0
n't 0
logon 0
. 0
Keyboard 3
could 0
use 0
some 0
trimming 0
. 0
The 0
bottomline 0
is 0
that 0
this 0
laptop 0
just 0
is 0
n't 0
worth 0
it 0
. 0
I 0
returned 0
the 0
computer 0
to 0
HP 0
and 0
they 0
kept 0
it 0
for 0
3 0
months 0
. 0
Its 0
white 0
color 1
is 0
stylish 0
for 0
college 0
students 0
and 0
easy 0
to 0
take 0
to 0
carry 0
and 0
take 0
to 0
classes 0
. 0
Returned 0
laptop 0
for 0
repair 0
a 0
2nd 0
time 0
and 0

When 0
I 0

next 0
to 0

HP 0
I 0
get 0
full 0

, 0
on 0
my 0
Eee 0
PC 0
I 0
get 0
3 0
bars 0
. 0
I 0
got 0
assurances 0
from 0
2 0
different 0
people 0
that 0
the 0
remaining 0
10 0
months 0
of 0
my 0
warranty 1
would 0
transfer 0
to 0
the 0
new 0
computer 0
. 0
Pretty 0
disappointed 0
about 0
this 0
product 0
. 0
The 0
letter 3
A 3
stopped 0
working 0
after 0
the 0
first 0
week 0
. 0
By 0
the 0
time 0
I 0
was 0
finally 0
able 0
to 0
get 0
a 0
work 0
order 0
to 0
get 0
it 0
fixed 0
I 0
had 0
been 0
without 0
my 0
computer 0
for 0
almost 0
a 0
week 0
while 0
I 0
was 0
an 0
Online 0
College 0
Student 0
, 0
so 0
it 0
was 0
very 0
inconvenient 0
and 0
I 0
had 0
to 0
send 0
it 0
off 0
and 0
be 0
without 0
it 0
while 0
it 0
was 0
being 0
fixed 0
also 0
. 0
Maybe 0
it 0
's 0
Acer 0
, 0
maybe 0
it 0
's 0
MSFT 0

So 0
if 0
you 0
want 0
a 0
good 0
machine 0
that 0
does 0
almost 0
anything 0
this 0
is 0
the 0
one 0
, 0
if 0
you 0
want 0
a 0
low 0

Not 0
a 0

it 0

a 0
bit 0
slow 0
, 0
but 0
gets 0
the 0
job 0
done 0

Honestly 0
, 0
I 0
spent 0
more 0
time 0
waiting 0
for 0
it 0

actually 0
doing 0
what 0

a 0
starter 0
notebook 0

No 0
I 0
am 0
generous 0
calling 0

slow 0

The 0
downside 0
to 0
this 0
netbook 0
is 0
pretty 0
much 0
the 0
same 0
for 0
any 0
netbook 0
: 0
screen 2

days 0

Allinall 0
, 0
I 0
would 0
definitely 0
recommend 0
this 0
product 0
for 0
nearly 0
everyone 0
. 0
in 0
5 0
months 0
the 0
connect 3
quality 3
got 0
worse 0
and 0
worse 0

The 0
big 0
screen 1
allows 0
you 0
to 0
enjoy 0
watching 0
movies 0
, 0

I 0
have 0
had 0
at 0

eight 0
Toshiba 0
laptops 0
, 0
and 0
they 0
have 0
been 0
outstanding 0
, 0
including 0
this 0
one 0

I 0
called 0
back 0
to 0
ensure 0
that 0
received 0
it 0
, 0
they 0
had 0
. 0
What 0
I 0
'd 0
like 0
is 0
for 0
the 0
laptop 0
to 0
run 2
well 0
without 0
having 0
to 0
purchase 0
additional 0
memory 3

If 0
you 0
can 0
afford 0
a 0
new 0
laptop 0
, 0
and 0
are 0
in 0
the 0
market 0
for 0
one 0
, 0
of 0
course 0
, 0
then 0
definitely 0
go 0
for 0
this 0
. 0
Got 0
the 0
computer 0
back 0
a 0
month 0
later 0
and 0
it 0
was 0
still 0
broken 0
sent 0
it 0
out 0
again 0
and 0
they 0
repaired 0
it 0
. 0
It 0
works 1
exactly 0
like 0
it 0
did 0
the 0
day 0
I 0
took 0
it 0
out 0
of 0
the 0
box 0
. 0
Now 0
, 0
the 0
next 0
issue 0
I 0
had 0
freaked 0
me 0
out 0
. 0
i 0
love 0
ths 0
notebook 0
. 0
It 0
is 0
fast 0
booting 1
up 1
, 0
shutting 1
down 1
, 0
and 0
connection 1
with 1
the 1
internet 1

The 0
battery 1
life 1
is 0
great 0

This 0
is 0
not 0
a 0
serious 0
gaming 3
laptop 0
or 0
a 0
serious 0
media 0
machine 0
; 0
Even 0
if 0
Apple 0
replaces 0
whatever 0
needs 0
replacing 0
I 0
wonder 0
if 0
, 0
since 0
I 0
seem 0
to 0
be 0
doubling 0
the 0
amount 0
of 0
time 0
I 0
get 0
out 0
of 0
it 0
each 0
time 0
it 0
's 0
like 0
new 0
, 0
I 0
might 0
have 0
8 0
months 0
next 0
time 0
. 0
I 0
got 0
this 0
laptop 0
on 0
Black 0
Friday 0
. 0
They 0
replaced 0
my 0
hard 2
drive 2
as 0
well 0
as 0
my 0
mother 2
board 2
. 0
I 0
fell 0
in 0
love 0
with 0
it 0
. 0
It 0
was 0
just 0
one 0
problem 0
after 0
another 0
for 0
me 0
, 0
and 0
that 0
's 0
reason 0
we 0
had 0
forked 0
out 0
so 0
much 0
money 0
was 0
so 0
we 0
would 0
n't 0
have 0
anything 0
to 0
worry 0
about 0
. 0
There 0
is 0
nothing 0
to 0
complain 0
about 0
the 0
system 1
. 0
and 0
it 0
comes 0
with 0
the 0
new 0
OSX 1
that 0
comes 0
with 0
new 0
features 1
that 0
makes 0
the 0
use 1
more 0
easy 0
. 0
Maybe 0
not 0
the 0
cutting 0
edge 0
Satellite 0
L455D 0
but 0
it 0
is 0
a 0
workhorse 0
. 0
But 0
the 0
Macbook 0
is 0
the 0
best 0
! 0
Now 0
the 0
screen 3
is 0
going 0
darker 0
, 0
darker 0
, 0
darker 0
. 0
EITHER 0
THE 0
COMPUTER 0
IS 0
TOO 0
SLOW 0
TO 0
DETECT 0
THE 0
KEYS 3
TYPED 0
THIS 0
IS 0
UNLIKELY 0
AS 0
I 0
AM 0
A 0
SLOW 0
TYPIST 0
OR 0
THE 0
KEYBOARD 3
SIMPLY 0
DOES 0
NOT 0
DETECT 0
THE 0

TYPED 0

I 0
got 0
the 0
black 0
MacBook 0
two 0
years 0

have 0
never 0
regretted 0
it 0

acting 0
extremely 0
slow 0
within 0
the 0
first 0
year 0

owning 0
them 0

when 0
i 0
called 0

have 0
another 0

ITEM 0

Couldnt 0
not 0
use 0
it 0
. 0
I 0
sent 0
it 0
back 0
and 0
found 0
this 0
time 0
that 0
the 0
battery 3
was 0
faulty 0
, 0
so 0
I 0
got 0
a 0
new 0
one 0
and 0
some 0
other 0
fixes 0
they 0
found 0
. 0
I 0
swear 0
they 0
design 0
these 0
things 0
to 0
go 0
to 0
crap 0
after 0
a 0
year 0
so 0
you 0
are 0
stuck 0
and 0
have 0
to 0
buy 0
a 0
new 0
one 0
. 0
Great 0
pick 0

They 0
did 0
n't 0
even 0
try 0
to 0
assist 0
me 0
or 0
even 0
offer 0
a 0
replacement 0
. 0
The 0
people 0
there 0
just 0
changed 0
for 0
me 0
on 0
the 0
spot 0
and 0
I 0
got 0
a 0
new 0
arm 1
piece 1
and 0
they 0
did 0
n't 0
even 0
request 0
for 0

I 0
love 0
my 0
Samsung 0

this 0
Netbook 0
was 0
a 0
very 0
poor 0
computer 0
. 0
I 0
made 0
a 0
perfect 0
decision 0
when 0
I 0
bought 0
the 0
Toshiba 0
! 0
I 0
take 0
it 0
everywhere 0
with 0
me 0
because 0
it 0
's 0
so 0
easy 0
to 0
carry 1
. 0
It 0
still 0
heats 0
up 0
like 0
mad 0
and 0
I 0
am 0
unable 0
to 0
use 0
it 0
with 0
the 0

more 0
than 0
five 0

ten 0
minutes 0
at 0
a 0
time 0
. 0
The 0
first 0
fell 0
apart 0
right 0
after 0
the 0

. 0
I 0
am 0
finding 0
my 0
way 0
around 0
this 0
laptop 0
better 0
than 0
my 0
last 0
one 0
. 0
They 0
told 0
me 0
it 0
was 0
my 0
loss 0
even 0
though 0
it 0
was 0
the 0
computer 0
, 0
not 0
what 0
I 0

About 0
2 0

! 0
The 0
keyboard 1

a 0
wonderful 0
nature 0

They 0
went 0
through 0
asking 0
me 0
open 0
up 0
various 0
components 0
, 0
taking 0
battery 2
out 0
, 0
hard 2
disk 2
apart 0
, 0
and 0
after 0
2 0
hours 0
on 0
phone 0
could 0
not 0
fix 0
it 0
. 0
4 0
weeks 0
after 0
giving 0
the 0
computer 0
for 0
repairAnnoyed 0
at 0

decided 0
to 0
send 0
complaint 0

to 0
Apple 0
. 0
While 0
there 0
are 0
occasions 0
that 0
my 0

will 0
need 0
to 0
be 0
manually 0
shut 0
down 0

less 0
frequently 0
than 0
on 0

The 0
battery 3
does 0
n't 0
last 0
long 0
but 0
I 0
'm 0
sure 0
an 0
upgrade 0
battery 3
would 0
solve 0
that 0
problem 0
. 0
I 0
was 0
looking 0
too 0
closely 0
at 0
the 0
other 0
performance 2
specs 2
and 0
while 0
comparing 0
, 0
I 0
took 0
it 0
for 0
granted 0
that 0
these 0
features 2
were 0
standard 0
. 0
I 0
did 0
a 0
lot 0
of 0
research 0
and 0
ended 0
up 0
thinking 0
this 0
Toshiba 0
was 0
the 0
best 0
one 0
for 0
me 0
. 0
I 0
've 0
had 0
it 0
now 0
about 0
2 0
months 0
and 0
absolutely 0
LOVE 0
IT 0
. 0
I 0
have 0
no 0
idea 0
how 0
this 0
could 0
have 0
even 0
gotten 0
past 0
quality 3
control 3
during 0
production 0
. 0
I 0
bought 0
this 0
last 0
week 0
, 0
and 0
the 0
very 0
next 0
day 0
had 0
to 0
return 0
it 0
because 0
it 0
over 0
heated 0
and 0
the 0
touchmouse 3
stopped 0
responding 0
. 0
I 0
am 0
so 0
happy 0
to 0
have 0
purchased 0
this 0
computer 0
. 0
I 0
returned 0
the 0
2nd 0
laptop 0
for 0
a 0
full 0
refund 0
. 0
really 0
no 0
problems 0
with 0
the 0
hand 0
me 0
down 0
computers 0
I 0
received 0
from 0
my 0
children 0
. 0
I 0
did 0
not 0
take 0
the 0
class 0
and 0
wish 0
that 0
I 0
would 0
have 0
. 0
But 0
the 0
arm 3
velcro 3
is 0
torn 0
after 0
one 0
use 0
. 0
Not 0
good 0
for 0
a 0
person 0
who 0
gets 0
online 0
daily 0
. 0
The 0
laptop 0
was 0
returned 0
but 0
audio 0

n't 0
even 0

how 0
I 0
finally 0
got 0
it 0

care 0
of 0
, 0
but 0
I 0
was 0
done 0
with 0
Sony 0
after 0

! 0
So 0
it 0

I 0
just 0
love 0
this 0
lap 0

just 0
wish 0
it 0
were 0
all 0
silver 0
or 0
they 0
had 0
all 0
black 0
. 0
The 0
software 1
is 0
amazing 0
. 0
We 0
carry 0
the 0
netbook 0
around 0
here 0
and 0
there 0
, 0
hence 0
it 0
's 0
kinda 0
of 0
irritating 0
when 0
the 0
LCD 3
just 0
slide 0
downwards 0
. 0
There 0
is 0
nothing 0
better 0
. 0
I 0

doing 0
any 0

you 0
should 0
know 0
that 0
many 0

not 0

it 0
. 0
Vista 3
is 0
a 0
nightmare 0
. 0
i 0
spent 0
eight 0
hundred 0
dollars 0
from 0
a 0
giant 0
paper 0
weight 0
that 0
looks 0
good 0
on 0
a 0
bus 0

I 0
have 0
used 0
a 0
couple 0
of 0
others 0
on 0
the 0
job 0
as 0
well 0
. 0
The 0
program 1
came 0
with 0
the 0

and 0
works 0
beautifully 0
. 0
Acer 0
wo 0
n't 0
replace 0
the 0
laptop 0
. 0
I 0
am 0
also 0
upset 0
with 0
CR 0
for 0
giving 0
a 0
good 0
rating 0
. 0
I 0
have 0
owned 0
macbook 0
pros 0
since 0
2005 0
and 0
this 0
is 0
the 0
best 0
yet 0
! 0
I 0
was 0
loving 0
this 0
Netbook 0
because 0
it 0
had 0
an 0
amazing 0
screen 1
and 0
display 1
and 0
was 0
small 0
and 0
light 0
, 0
but 0
after 0
1 0
week 0
it 0
stopped 0
openning 0
web 0
pages 0
for 0
me 0
even 0
after 0
installing 0
new 0
browsers 2
then 0
eventually 0
it 0
just 0
started 0
giving 0
me 0
a 0
blue 0
screen 1
and 0
crashing 0
everytime 0
I 0
booted 0
it 0
. 0
Now 0
I 0
could 0
get 0
myself 0
a 0
cheap 0
computer 0
, 0
that 0
will 0
probably 0
work 0
a 0
whole 0
lot 0
better 0
! 0
The 0
So 0
called 0
laptop 0
Runs 3
to 0
Slow 0
and 0
I 0
hate 0
it 0
! 0
This 0
is 0
the 0
first 0
laptop 0
I 0
've 0
owned 0
, 0
althougth 0
I 0
used 0
several 0
at 0
my 0
previous 0
job 0
. 0
Those 0
moments 0
in 0
thime 0
where 0
you 0
want 0
to 0
throw 0
something 0
against 0
the 0
wall 0
? 0
Yeah 0
, 0
I 0
wanted 0
to 0
throw 0
that 0
lap 0
top 0
out 0
the 0
window 0
and 0
light 0
it 0
on 0
fire 0
. 0
Charger 3
seems 0
large 0
for 0
this 0
class 0
of 0
computer 0
. 0
I 0
do 0
n't 0
really 0
have 0
a 0
complaint 0
. 0
I 0
'm 0
pretty 0
sure 0
it 0
's 0
not 0
newegg 0
's 0
fault 0
but 0
when 0
you 0
turn 0
on 0
a 0
computer 0
you 0
just 0
bought 0
you 0
want 0
it 0
to 0
at 0
least 0
get 0
to 0
desktop 0
. 0
Best 0
Buy 0
ended 0
up 0
junking 0
the 0
computer 0
and 0
giving 0
me 0
a 0
replacement 0
computer 0
. 0
I 0
dislike 0
the 0
quality 0
and 0
the 0
placement 0
of 0
the 0
speakers 3
. 0
If 0
I 0
have 0
a 0
problem 0
with 0
any 0
of 0
my 0
apple 0
items 0
I 0
make 0
an 0
appointment 0
at 0
one 0
of 0
my 0
local 0
stores 0
and 0
they 0
work 0
on 0
correcting 0
it 0
right 0
there 0
. 0
So 0
I 0
called 0
customer 1
support 1
which 0
is 0
good 0
too 0
and 0
they 0
went 0
through 0
it 0
and 0
it 0
is 0
just 0
a 0
safety 2
feature 2
and 0
it 0
does 0
not 0
affect 0
performance 2
at 0
all 0
, 0
I 0
just 0
chose 0
to 0
hide 0
the 0
message 0
. 0
I 0
claim 0
that 0
this 0
has 0
no 0
value 0
to 0
me 0
, 0
the 0
laptop 0
was 0
new 0
anyway 0
. 0
Enough 0
said 0
. 0
Not 0
working 0
= 0
bad 0
i 0
would 0
really 0
recommend 0
to 0
any 0
person 0
out 0
there 0
to 0
get 0
this 0
laptop 0
cause 0
its 0
really 0
worth 0
it 0
. 0
Otherwise 0
this 0
little 0
notebook 0
has 0
met 0
all 0
my 0
expectations 0
. 0
My 0
son 0
said 0
it 0
popped 0
up 0
and 0
he 0
clicked 0
update 0
. 0
I 0
lost 0
two 0
items 0
I 0
was 0
working 0
on 0
until 0
I 0
figured 0
out 0
what 0
was 0
happening 0
. 0
The 0
unibody 1
design 1
is 0
edgy 0
and 0
durable 0
. 0
STOPPED 0
BOOTING 3
UP 3
less 0
than 0
a 0
week 0
after 0
my 0
oneyear 2
warranty 2
was 0
up 0
. 0
But 0
, 0
for 0
the 0
cost 1
this 0
is 0
a 0
winner 0
. 0
Let 0
me 0
tell 0
you 0
, 0
this 0
machine 0
is 0
great 0
. 0
I 0
have 0
used 0
a 0
computer 0
at 0
work 0
but 0
having 0
your 0
own 0
personal 0
laptop 0
is 0
AWSOME 0
! 0
Later 0
it 0
held 0
zero 0
charge 3
and 0
its 0
replacement 0
worked 0
for 0
less 0
than 0
three 0
months 0
. 0
The 0
second 0
issue 0
I 0
had 0
with 0
it 0
occured 0
a 0
month 0
later 0
and 0
it 0
kept 0
overheating 0
, 0
even 0
if 0
on 0
for 0
less 0
than 0
an 0
hour 0
! 0
Also 0
, 0
the 0
battery 3
does 0
not 0
last 0
very 0
long 0
at 0
all 0
. 0
Good 0
luck 0
with 0
your 0
purchase 0
options 0
. 0
Buy 0
this 0
if 0
you 0
like 0
being 0
tortured 0
, 0
teased 0
, 0
frustrated 0
and 0
wasting 0
twice 0
as 0
much 0
time 0
as 0
you 0
spent 0
using 0
your 0
old 0
Mac 0
. 0
Very 0
disappointed 0
! 0
They 0
are 0
asking 0
me 0
to 0
ship 0
the 0
unit 0
back 0
to 0
fix 0
it 0
at 0
their 0
site 0
. 0
I 0
bought 0
it 0
from 0
HSN 0
because 0
it 0
was 0
bundled 0
with 0
extra 0
software 3
, 0
but 0
as 0
it 0
turns 0
out 0
, 0
that 0
software 3
just 0
crashes 0
it 0
more 0
often 0
. 0
I 0
constantly 0
had 0
to 0
send 0
my 0
laptop 0
in 0
for 0
services 3
every 0
3 0
months 0
and 0
it 0
always 0
seems 0
to 0
be 0
the 0
same 0
problem 0
that 0
they 0
said 0
they 0
had 0
already 0
fixed 0
. 0
Unless 0
you 0
need 0
the 0
Bluetooth 2
3 2
. 0
I 0
was 0
sorly 0
disapointed 0
to 0
discover 0
that 0
HP 0
what 0
I 0
thought 0
was 0
a 0
reputable 0
company 0
would 0
n't 0
honor 0
the 0
warrenty 3
when 0
the 0
fan 3
blade 3
fell 0
apart 0
. 0
That 0
is 0
pretty 0
sad 0
when 0
they 0
name 0
them 0
specifically 0
. 0
More 0
times 0
that 0
not 0
the 0
screen 0
pops 0
up 0
saying 0
I 0
have 0
a 0
bad 0
internet 3
connection 3

ca 0
n't 0

It 0
is 0
everything 0
that 0
I 0
would 0
want 0
in 0

yourself 0
a 0

If 0

a 0

them 0

about 0
$ 0
150 0
I 0
went 0
with 0
him 0
and 0
we 0
picked 0
this 0
one 0
. 0
While 0
most 0
people 0
say 0
that 0
PCs 0
hold 0
functionality 1
and 0
value 1
and 0
Macs 0
are 0
just 0
pretty 0
to 0
look 1
at 0
, 0
I 0
think 0
there 0
's 0
something 0
to 0
be 0
said 0
about 0
the 0
simplicity 1
of 0
Macs 0
. 0
This 0
is 0
my 0
second 0
MACBOOK 0
PRO 0
and 0
it 0
's 0
better 0
than 0
ever 0
. 0
My 0
macbook 0
is 0
so 0
much 0
better 0
looking 1
and 0
so 0
thin 0
! 0
The 0
notebook 0
would 0
not 0
turn 0
back 0
on 0
again 0
. 0
The 0
ease 0
of 0
use 1
is 0
wonderful 0
. 0
This 0
system 0
came 0
loaded 0
with 0
Windows 2
7 2
Starter 2
. 0
When 0
battery 3
life 3
went 0
to 0
4 0
hours 0
or 0
less 0
, 0
took 0
it 0
to 0
the 0
MacHouse 0
Amsterdam 0
for 0
repair 0
26th 0
of 0
August 0
. 0
The 0
battery 3
gets 0
so 0
HOT 0
it 0
is 0
scary 0
. 0
It 0
's 0
so 0
nice 0
to 0
look 1
at 0
and 0
the 0
keys 1
are 0
easy 0
to 0
type 0
with 0
. 0
The 0
apple 0
macbook 0
pro 0
nothing 0
to 0
say 0
butprofessionally 0
great 0
and 0
outstanding 0
. 0
It 0
's 0
also 0
very 0
energy 0
efficient 0
, 0
running 0
on 0
a 0
quarter 0
of 0
the 0
power 0
it 0
takes 0
to 0
run 0
a 0
60 0
Watt 0
lightbulb 0
. 0
I 0
am 0
forever 0
changed 0
and 0
will 0
no 0
longer 0
buy 0
a 0
Windows 3
based 0
machine 0
for 0
personal 0
use 0
. 0
Mom 0
, 0
Dad 0
, 0
Brother 0
, 0
sister 0
, 0
You 0
name 0
it 0
! 0
but 0
it 0
came 0
back 0
in 0
even 0
worse 0
shape 0
. 0
The 0
only 0
thing 0
I 0
would 0
change 0
about 0
it 0
is 0
the 0
mouse 3
keys 3
. 0
It 0
is 0
absolutely 0
horrible 0
to 0
use 3
, 0
despite 0
all 0
its 0
so 0
called 0
advanced 0
features 3
. 0
Before 0
, 0
I 0
reloaded 0
with 0
Windows 2
7 2
Ultimate 2
and 0
used 0
only 0
the 0
downloaded 0
drivers 2
from 0
Acer 0
's 0
site 0
. 0
I 0
have 0
to 0
keep 0
turning 0
it 0
until 0
it 0
decides 0
to 0
lower 0
and 0
there 0
is 0
no 0
mute 3
. 0
After 0
that 0
I 0
turned 0
to 0
email 0
in 0
my 0
next 0
vain 0
help 0
to 0
get 0
them 0
to 0
acknowledge 0
that 0
the 0
warranty 2
was 0
still 0
valid 0
. 0
So 0
far 0
, 0
a 0
great 0
product 0
. 0
He 0
loves 0
it 0
and 0
it 0
is 0
easy 0
to 0
use 1
and 0
well 0
the 0
schools 0
start 0
teaching 0
the 0
kids 0
early 0
about 0
computers 0
so 0
it 0
was 0
easy 0
for 0
him 0
to 0
get 0
started 0
. 0
u 0
can 0
do 0
what 0
u 0
want 0
in 0
just 0
few 0
seconds 0
, 0
even 0
to 0
start 1
up 1
your 0
computer 0
takes 0
few 0
seconds 0
. 0
It 0
's 0
the 0
most 0
wonderful 0
thing 0
in 0
the 0
entire 0
world 0
. 0
So 0
I 0
'd 0
pop 0
them 0
off 0
to 0
see 0
what 0
the 0
problem 0
was 0
, 0
well 0
guess 0
what 0
? 0
The 0
darn 0
thing 0
would 0
n't 0
go 0
back 0
on 0
. 0
Also 0
, 0
macbooks 0
come 0
with 0
much 0
more 0
features 1
which 0
are 0
so 0
cool 0
! 0
They 0
have 0
developed 0
excellent 0
proprietary 1
software 1
for 0
editing 0
video 0
and 0
pictures 0
and 0
I 0
'm 0
looking 0
forward 0
to 0
utilizing 0
these 0
tools 0
on 0
the 0
regular 0
. 0
Getting 0
the 0
Apple 1
Care 1
plan 1
is 0
a 0
must 0
. 0
I 0
've 0
saved 0
a 0
lot 0
of 0
time 0
and 0
headaches 0
so 0
far 0
, 0
using 0
my 0
new 0
MacBook 0
Pro 0
. 0
overall 0
i 0
would 0
recomend 0
this 0
to 0
anybody 0
and 0
tell 0
them 0
that 0
if 0
they 0
want 0
to 0
burn 0
their 0
music 0
or 0
play 0
there 0
video 2
games 2
to 0
buy 0
the 0
cd 2
drive 2
. 0
Apple 0
offers 0
to 0
send 0
replacement 0
and 0
after 0
10 0
days 0
I 0
send 0
them 0
the 0
old 0
computer 0
. 0
So 0
far 0
, 0
I 0
have 0
no 0
complaints 0
. 0
His 0
was 0
worth 0
$ 0
36 0
. 0
I 0
spent 0
2200 0
dollars 0
on 0
a 0
top 0
of 0
the 0
line 0
laptop 0
. 0
I 0
also 0
own 0
an 0
HP 0
notebook 0
and 0
it 0
does 0
n't 0
even 0
come 0
close 0
. 0
Our 0
Apple 0
13.3 0
MacBook 0
Pro 0
Notebook 0
Computer 0
Z0J80001 0
Notebook 0
and 0
has 0
become 0
such 0
an 0
integral 0
part 0
of 0
completing 0
our 0
daily 0
needs 0
and 0
social 0
networking 0
. 0
I 0
am 0
constantly 0
trying 0
to 0
uninstall 0
programs 2
, 0
clean 0
cookies 0
, 0
and 0
delete 0
unused 0
files 0
. 0
The 0
dv4 0
boasted 0
a 0
faster 0
processor 1
, 0
more 0
memory 1
, 0
and 0
a 0
bigger 0
hard 1
drive 1
than 0
my 0
old 0
computer 0
, 0
plus 0
a 0
better 0
quality 0
web 1
cam 1
, 0
nicer 0
screen 1
, 0
and 0
many 0
other 0
features 1
. 0
The 0
only 0
downfall 0
is 0
the 0
battery 3
only 0
last 0
1.52.0 0
hrs 0
when 0
not 0
plugged 0
in 0
. 0
Aside 0
from 0
the 0
trial 3
software 3
and 0
the 0
short 0
battery 3
life 3
, 0
lack 0
of 0
a 0
webcam 3
, 0
its 0
great 0
. 0
As 0
a 0
diehard 0
Windows 1
enthusiast 0
, 0
I 0
shunned 0
the 0
idea 0
of 0
a 0
Mac 0
until 0
this 0
point 0
. 0
I 0
think 0
that 0
if 0
it 0
is 0
the 0
motherboard 3
again 0
so 0
soon 0
that 0
they 0
should 0
replace 0
it 0
. 0
if 0
this 0
computer 0
every 0
breaks 0
down 0
on 0
me 0
i 0
will 0
most 0
definatly 0
get 0
the 0
same 0
one 0
again 0
. 0
I 0
had 0
a 0
MacBook 0
Notebook 0
, 0
and 0
it 0
had 0
absolutely 0
no 0
protection 0
from 0
viruses 0
, 0
spyware 0
, 0
malware 0
, 0
etc 0
. 0
I 0
made 0
the 0
right 0
decision 0
. 0
In 0
the 0
past 0
few 0
years 0
, 0
I 0
've 0
had 0
terrible 0
experiences 0
with 0
HP 0
. 0
Graphics 1
are 0
clean 0
and 0
sharp 0
, 0
internet 1
interfaces 1
are 0
seamless 0
. 0
The 0
newer 0
black 3
keyboard 3
took 0
a 0
little 0
bit 0
away 0
from 0
the 0
previous 0
gray 0
one 0
which 0
looked 0
really 0
slick 0
, 0
but 0
it 0
is 0
still 0
a 0
great 0
notebook 0
! 0
Sony 0
parts 0
reliability 0
and 0
quality 0
of 0
service 3
is 0
recenlty 0
the 0
worst 0
. 0
I 0
am 0
very 0
Happy 0
! 0
As 0
with 0
any 0
laptop 0
not 0
purchased 0
with 0
software 3
options 3
, 0
it 0
comes 0
with 0
a 0
lot 0
of 0
what 0
I 0
consider 0
useless 0
applications 3
. 0
Its 0
Office 1
compatible 0
, 0
but 0
the 0
features 2
and 0
its 0
functioning 2
is 0
all 0
new 0
again 0
so 0
you 0
might 0
as 0
well 0
save 0
the 0
money 0
and 0
just 0
learn 0
the 0
pre 0
installed 0
mac 0
programs 2
. 0
I 0
occassionaly 0
use 0
it 0
for 0
work 0
via 0
VPN 0
and 0
it 0
has 0
not 0
given 0
me 0
any 0
problems 0
. 0
I 0
sent 0
it 0
back 0
AND 0
THEY 0
LOST 0
IT 0
. 0
It 0
just 0
works 1
flawlessly 0
! 0
Do 0
you 0
think 0
I 0
purposely 0
destroy 0
my 0
netbook 0
, 0
so 0
that 0
I 0
can 0
demand 0
a 0
new 0
set 0
? 0
Do 0
you 0
think 0
it 0
's 0
fun 0
to 0
take 0
public 0
transport 0
all 0
the 0
way 0
to 0
the 0
service 3
center 3
and 0
get 0
a 0
nonsatisfactory 0
solution 0
? 0
Or 0
rather 0
NO 0
solution 0
. 0
I 0
'm 0
having 0
the 0
laptop 0
returned 0
unrepaired 0
since 0
paying 0
$ 0
176 0
every 0
3 0
months 0
just 0
is 0
n't 0
worth 0
it 0
that 0
's 0
about 0
how 0
long 0
the 0
port 3
seems 0
to 0
last 0
. 0
Ok 0
first 0
. 0
So 0
if 0
you 0
move 0
laptop 0
a 0
lot 0
, 0
it 0
might 0
get 0
loose 0
, 0
however 0
it 0
sits 0
pretty 0
tightly 0
. 0
another 0
satisfied 0
customer 0
. 0
also 0
the 0
battery 3
is 0
completely 0
shot 0
. 0
Highly 0
recommended 0
! 0
The 0
biggest 0
problem 0
is 0
that 0
the 0
box 0
had 0
no 0
instructions 3
in 0
it 0
. 0
But 0
after 0
using 0
it 0
a 0
couple 0
of 0
weeks 0
, 0
the 0
overall 0
operation 3
is 0
poor 0
. 0
for 0
two 0
months 0
, 0
when 0
YOU 0
GUESSED 0
IT 0
. 0
This 0
was 0
my 0
first 0
MacBook 0
purchase 0
ever 0
. 0
Screen 1
is 0
crystal 0
clear 0
and 0
the 0
system 1
is 0
very 0
responsive 0
. 0
I 0
will 0
stack 0
it 0
up 0
against 0
laptops 0
that 0
cost 0
twice 0
as 0
much 0
any 0
day 0
. 0
Quite 0
simply 0
this 0
is 0
the 0
best 0
laptop 0
I 0
have 0
ever 0
owned 0
. 0
Or 0
the 0
cursor 3
would 0
show 0
up 0
some 0
place 0
else 0
. 0
The 0
newer 0
MacBook 0
that 0
I 0
have 0
purchased 0
is 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
best 0
computers 0
. 0
I 0
have 0
had 0
some 0
excellent 0
computer 0
and 0
have 0
found 0
I 0
had 0
no 0
idea 0
what 0
to 0
do 0
with 0
them 0
As 0
it 0
turns 0
out 0
, 0
I 0
just 0
did 0
n't 0
know 0
any 0
better 0
. 0
I 0
've 0
had 0
friends 0
with 0
Acers 0
who 0
seem 0
to 0
have 0
had 0
similar 0
or 0
exact 0
same 0
problems 0
. 0
What 0
can 0
I 0
say 0
. 0
It 0
is 0
easy 0
to 0
operate 1
and 0
I 0
have 0
already 0
ordered 0
more 0
software 2
and 0
gadgets 2
for 0
my 0
new 0
Rolls 0
Royce 0
of 0
laptops 0
. 0
What 0
's 0
also 0
interesting 0
is 0
this 0
survey 0
changed 0
my 0
ratings 0
the 0
first 0
time 0
I 0
submitted 0
it 0
in 0
case 0
it 0
does 0
n't 0
keep 0
what 0
I 0
put 0
here 0
are 0
my 0
aratings 0
it 0
might 0
be 0
something 0
deep 0
within 0
Windows 3
, 0
for 0
I 0
was 0
unable 0
to 0
create 0
a 0
disk 3
image 3
on 0
my 0
hard 3
drive 3
. 0
I 0
had 0
a 0
toshiba 0
for 0
10 0
years 0
. 0
The 0
track 1
pad 1
to 0
me 0
is 0
what 0
really 0
stands 0
out 0
though 0
, 0
you 0
can 0
do 0
several 0
different 0
things 0
with 0
it 0
just 0
depending 0
on 0
how 0
many 0
fingers 0
you 0
use 0
on 0
the 0
track 1
pad 1

awesome 0
thinking 0

Now 0

after 0

not 0
used 0
the 0
right 0
drive 3
when 0
they 0
replaced 0

to 0

With 0
in 0

The 0
OS 0
takes 0
some 0
getting 0
used 0
to 0
especially 0
after 0
being 0
a 0
Windows 2
user 0
for 0
so 0
long 0
but 0
the 0
learning 0
curve 0
is 0
so 0
worth 0
it 0
! 0
It 0
quit 0
working 0
within 0
a 0
weeks 0
time 0
. 0
but 0
after 0
i 0
got 0
used 0
to 0
it 0
i 0
love 0
it 0
. 0
I 0
also 0
purchased 0
iWork 2
to 0
go 0
with 0
it 0
which 0
has 0
programs 2
for 0
word 2
processing 2
, 0
spreadsheets 2
, 0
and 0
presentations 2
similar 0
to 0
Microsoft 2
Office 2
. 0
Overall 0
, 0
I 0
experienced 0
a 0
huge 0
change 0
in 0
that 0
my 0
mac 0
runs 1
pretty 0
fast 0
compared 0
to 0
my 0
old 0
PC 0
. 0
When 0
I 0
got 0
the 0
computer 0
back 0
and 0
realizwed 0
it 0
still 0
was 0
not 0
correct 0
HP 0
told 0
me 0
it 0
was 0
out 0
of 0
warranty 2
and 0
now 0
it 0
was 0
my 0
problem 0
. 0
It 0
also 0
came 0
with 0
a 0
built 1
it 1
web 1
cam 1
which 0
is 0
great 0
because 0
I 0
can 0
see 0
an 0
communicate 0
with 0
my 0
family 0
members 0
back 0
home 0
. 0
Good 0
monitor 1
and 0
performed 1
well 0
. 0
They 0
are 0
closed 0
at 0
9pm 0
eastern 0
. 0
In 0
those 0
three 0
years 0
, 0
I 0
've 0
had 0
a 0
couple 0
of 0
minor 0
problems 0
and 0
both 0
were 0
resolved 0
by 0
Apple 0
quickly 0
and 0
easily 0
. 0
Although 0
my 0
model 0
was 0
listed 0
as 0
recalled 0
, 0
HP 0
denied 0
my 0
claim 0
. 0
I 0
was 0
a 0
little 0
weary 0
at 0
purchasing 0
another 0
13 0
macbook 0
almost 0
2 0
years 0
later 0
but 0
t 0
looks 0
like 0
the 0
newer 0
macbooks 0
have 0
gotten 0
its 0
current 0
line 0
of 0
graphics 1
cards 1
in 0
order 0
this 0
time 0
around 0
. 0
I 0
am 0
loyal 0
to 0
Apple 0
. 0
They 0
are 0
by 0
far 0
the 0
easiest 0
systems 1
to 0
actually 0
learn 0
about 0
computers 0
with 0
. 0
I 0
will 0
be 0
patient 0
for 0
few 0
months 0
. 0
this 0
apple 0
navigates 0
you 0
thru 0
the 0
unexplored 0
world 0
of 0
the 0
internet 2
. 0
This 0
was 0
purchased 0
for 0
my 0
daughter 0
and 0
I 0
was 0
pleasantly 0
surprised 0
. 0
Finally 0
set 0
the 0
unit 0
back 0
to 0
HP 0
after 0
a 0
month 0
of 0
hell 0
. 0
I 0
could 0
n't 0
afford 0
a 0
new 0
mac 0
, 0
so 0
I 0
bought 0
a 0
PC 0
instead 0
. 0
The 0
video 0
card 0
is 0
great 0
for 0
media 1
, 0
and 0
above 0
average 0
for 0
gaming 1
, 0
but 0
not 0
a 0
gamers 0
first 0
choice 0
. 0
It 0
was 0
always 0
getting 0
froze 0
up 0
. 0
my 0
information 0
was 0
all 0
lost 0
my 0
fault 0
, 0
I 0
know 0
, 0
but 0
I 0
never 0
thought 0
I 0
would 0
need 0
to 0
back 0
up 0
my 0
information 0
on 0
a 0
brand 0
new 0
Mac 0
, 0
the 0
paragon 0
of 0
all 0
computers 0
! 0
I 0
got 0
the 0
blue 0
screen 0
of 0
death 0
the 0
first 0
month 0
I 0
got 0
it 0
. 0
This 0
is 0
the 0
third 0
MacBook 0
Pro 0
in 0
our 0
family 0
. 0
Apple 0
continues 0
to 0
shine 0
and 0
provide 0
a 0
much 0
more 0
enjoyable 0
computer 0
experience 0
! 0
I 0
had 0
of 0
course 0
bought 0
a 0
3 2
year 2
warranty 2
, 0
so 0
I 0
sent 0
it 0
in 0
to 0
be 0
replaced 0
and 0
almost 0
2 0
months 0
later 0
the 0
dv4 0
is 0
what 0
the 0
sent 0
me 0
as 0
a 0
replacement 0
. 0
Apparently 0
there 0
is 0
a 0
manufacturing 0
defect 0
, 0
something 0
with 0
the 0
amount 0
of 0
thermal 3
paste 3
. 0
Despite 0
the 0
claims 0
of 0
the 0
Apple 0
apologists 0
a 0
vice 0
of 0
which 0
I 0
am 0
recently 0
myself 0
reformed 0
the 0
internals 3
of 0
Mac 0
laptops 0
are 0
NO 0
different 0
from 0
PCs' 0
at 0
this 0
point 0
. 0
Took 0
several 0
hours 0
with 0
customer 3
support 3
before 0
I 0
could 0
even 0
start 0
the 0
PC 0
out 0
of 0
the 0
box 0
. 0
Windows 3
Vista 3
makes 0
this 0
computer 0
almost 0
unusable 0
for 0
online 3
service 3
. 0
I 0
contacted 0
Acer 0
and 0
they 0
are 0
giving 0
me 0
FREE 0
recovery 1
DVDs 1
, 0
so 0
do 0
n't 0
go 0
and 0
pay 0
for 0
them 0
, 0
just 0
ask 0
for 0
them 0
and 0
they 0
should 0
give 0
them 0
to 0
you 0
. 0
Now 0
when 0
I 0
order 0
I 0
did 0
not 0
go 0
full 0
scale 0
for 0
the 0
webcam 2
or 0
full 0
keyboard 2
I 0
wanted 0
something 0
for 0
basics 0
of 0
being 0
easy 0
to 0
carry 1
when 0
I 0
use 0
crutchs 0
or 0
wheelchair 0
and 0
with 0
a 0
backpack 0
laptop 0
bag 0
. 0
Can 0
listen 0
to 0
my 0
music 0
and 0
watch 0
my 0
videos 0
with 0
ease 0
and 0
with 0
a 0
great 0
display 1
. 0
Otherwise 0
, 0
all 0
other 0
features 2
are 0
a 0
1 0
So 0
in 0
late 0
March 0
, 0
early 0
April 0
2009 0
I 0
was 0
without 0
it 0
again 0
for 0
a 0
couple 0
weeks 0
while 0
I 0
had 0
online 0
courses 0
I 0
had 0
to 0
complete 0
and 0
my 0
fiance 0
was 0
in 0
Afghanistan 0
and 0
web 0
conferencing 0
was 0
the 0
best 0
communication 0
method 0
we 0
had 0
. 0
The 0
performance 1
is 0
awesome 0
. 0
I 0
pondered 0
very 0
long 0
over 0
this 0
decision 0
. 0
This 0
thing 0
sucks 0
! 0
I 0
Love 0
my 0
new 0
computer 0
! 0
Okay 0
, 0
let 0
's 0
just 0
start 0
out 0
by 0
saying 0
I 0
am 0
in 0
no 0
way 0
a 0
computer 0
techy 0
. 0
It 0
was 0
a 0
Waste 0
of 0
money 0
from 0
day 0
one 0
! 0
So 0
I 0
got 0
another 0
netbook 0
which 0
I 0
love 0
! 0
But 0
in 0
fact 0
it 0
is 0
totally 0
the 0
opposite 0
. 0
The 0
display 3
is 0
beyond 0
horrible 0
. 0
He 0
LEFT 0
ME 0
, 0
instructions 0
on 0
what 0
to 0
do 0
when 0
this 0
comes 0
up 0
, 0
or 0
that 0
comes 0
up 0
. 0
It 0
's 0
a 0
joke 0
. 0
There 0
is 0
hardly 0
any 0
memory 3
on 0
the 0
computer 0
's 0
hard 3
drive 3
. 0
Actually 0
, 0
I 0
had 0
noticed 0
the 0
one 0
on 0
the 0
sales 0
floor 0
also 0
did 0
n't 0
have 0
sound 3
! 0
I 0
started 0
hainv 0
problems 0
with 0
it 0
within 0
the 0
first 0
month 0
. 0
Next 0
, 0
most 0
Acer 0
laptop 0
fans 2
are 0
on 0
the 0
bottom 0
which 0
is 0
right 0
on 0
your 0
laptop 0
. 0
the 0
laptop 0
preformed 1
pretty 0
well 0
. 0
I 0
'm 0
honestly 0
afraid 0
that 0
it 0
will 0
burn 0
me 0
, 0
it 0
's 0
that 0
hot 0
! 0
But 0
I 0
do 0
n't 0
see 0
it 0
as 0
a 0
problem 0
. 0
Numerous 0
problems 0
over 0
the 0
next 0
3 0
weeks 0
until 0
I 0
got 0
the 0
blue 0
screen 0
of 0
death 0
and 0
had 0
to 0
send 0
the 0
PC 0
back 0
to 0
HP 0
. 0
This 0
one 0
has 0
had 0
the 0
same 0
effect 0
. 0
And 0
if 0
you 0
are 0
a 0
game 0
player 0
it 0
works 0
with 0
World 0
Of 0
Warcraft 0
wonderfully 0
. 0
I 0
found 0
this 0
laptop 0
on 0
sale 0
for 0
under 0
6000 0
at 0
Best 0
Buy 0
which 0
was 0
a 0
great 0
deal 0
! 0
I 0
got 0
my 0
MacBook 0
Pro 0
because 0
I 0
wanted 0
to 0
do 0
all 0
the 0
stuff 0
I 0
need 0
to 0
do 0
without 0
worrying 0
about 0
the 0
system 2
quitting 0
on 0
me 0
or 0
freezing 0
for 0
a 0
few 0
minutes 0
. 0
I 0
love 0
the 0
Apple 0
products 0
. 0
I 0
loved 0
the 0
netbook 0
minus 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
it 0
was 0
windows 3
OS 3
until 0
this 0
started 0
happening 0
. 0
They 0
're 0
absolutely 0
useless 0
, 0
unless 0
you 0
count 0
the 0
joy 0
of 0
releasing 0
anger 0
while 0
smashing 0
into 0
little 0
peices 0
against 0
the 0
wall 0
. 0
was 0
a 0
great 0
deal 0
i 0
will 0
give 0
that 0
. 0
Theres 0
also 0
iDVD 1
, 0
a 0
program 1
dedicated 0
to 0
putting 0
all 0
your 0
favorite 0
media 0
together 0
photos 0
, 0
recordings 0
, 0
video 0
projects 0
into 0
one 0

your 0

and 0
any 0
other 0
person 0
important 0
in 0
your 0
life 0
that 0
there 0
may 0
be 0
. 0
His 0
language 0
was 0
so 0
bad 0
I 0
swore 0
I 0
was 0
taking 0
the 0
turing 0
test 0
, 0
and 0
it 0
was 0
failing 0
. 0
Was 0
this 0
product 0
worth 0
my 0
time 0
and 0
money 0
to 0
ever 0
want 0
to 0
purchase 0
another 0
products 0
that 0
is 0
toshiba 0
or 0
relating 0
to 0
toshiba 0
? 0
Probably 0
not 0
ever 0
again 0
. 0
I 0
have 0
used 0
PC 0
's 0
and 0
converting 0
to 0
this 0
MacBook 0
Pro 0
was 0
easy 0
. 0
If 0
what 0
you 0
need 0
is 0
a 0
machine 0
to 0
do 0
some 0
surfing 2
, 0
email 0
checking 0
, 0
word 2
processing 2
, 0
and 0
watching 0
a 0
movie 0
or 0
two 0
, 0
this 0
is 0
the 0
machine 0
you 0
want 0
. 0
Apparently 0
, 0
contactus 0
@ 0
euro.apple.com 0
is 0
not 0
a 0
good 0
address 0
to 0
send 0
complaints 0
. 0
It 0
does 0
n't 0
have 0
a 0
lot 0
of 0
frills 0
, 0
but 0
I 0
did 0
n't 0
need 0
any 0
, 0
and 0
being 0
able 0
to 0
buy 0
what 0
I 0
needed 0
, 0
and 0
not 0
more 0
than 0
I 0
needed 0
was 0
very 0
important 0
. 0
the 0
mouse 3
pad 3
and 0
buttons 3
are 0
the 0
worst 0
i 0
've 0
ever 0
seen 0
. 0
I 0
am 0
sorry 0
that 0
I 0
purchased 0
this 0
laptop 0
. 0
Awesome 0
graphics 1
! 0
It 0
really 0
is 0
perfect 0
for 0
work 1
and 0
play 1
. 0
The 0
pro 0
is 0
a 0
great 0
product 0
, 0
I 0
wish 0
that 0
the 0
13 0
inch 0
models 0
came 0
with 0
the 0
Intel 3
i 3
processors 3
and 0
had 0
a 0
more 0
comfortable 0
edge 3
the 0
edges 3
hurt 0
my 0
wrists 0
. 0
I 0
am 0
a 0
college 0
student 0
and 0
it 0
has 0
been 0
very 0
useful 0
. 0
The 0
apple 0
MacBook 0
is 0
the 0
best 0
investment 0
that 0
I 0
have 0
ever 0
made 0
. 0
My 0
sister 0
is 0
the 0
electronics 0
manager 0
at 0
Wal 0
Mart 0
and 0
she 0
says 0
that 0
HP 0
is 0
the 0
best 0
. 0
The 0
battery 3
life 3
sucked 0
the 0
juice 0
from 0
my 0
laptop 0
and 0
when 0
the 0
extended 0
life 0
battery 0
went 0
out 0
we 0
were 0
SOL 0
there 0
to 0
, 0
so 0
much 0
for 0
that 0
warranty 3
covering 0
all 0
the 0
products 0
we 0
purchased 0
. 0
I 0
needed 0
a 0
new 0
computer 0
for 0
graduate 0
school 0
had 0
never 0
owned 0
a 0
laptop 0
before 0
, 0
and 0
the 0
only 0
reason 0
I 0
did 0
n't 0
purchase 0
a 0
Mac 0
was 0
because 0
my 0
school 0
's 0
website 0
strongly 0
recommended 0
students 0
purchase 0
PCs 0
. 0
I 0
have 0
had 0
another 0
Mac 0
, 0
but 0
it 0
got 0
slow 0
due 0
to 0
an 0
older 0
operating 3
system 3
. 0
If 0
you 0
have 0
the 0
money 0
I 0
suggest 0
going 0
for 0
the 0
i7 0
. 0
That 0
's 0
very 0
possible 0
, 0
but 0
since 0
they 0
do 0
n't 0
make 0
Windows 3
XP 3
drivers 3
for 0
the 0
sound 3
card 3
in 0
this 0
machine 0
, 0
I 0
was 0
stuck 0
until 0
Windows 1
7 1
came 0
out 0
. 0
I'ts 0
nice 0
to 0
have 0
the 0
higherend 0
laptops 0
, 0
but 0
this 0
fits 0
my 0
budget 1
and 0
the 0
features 1
I 0
need 0
. 0
It 0
is 0
, 0
however 0
, 0
very 0
heavy 0
. 0
Was 0
disappointed 0
to 0
find 0
out 0
that 0
the 0
model 0
had 0
been 0
discontinued 0
, 0
apparently 0
because 0
of 0
known 0
motherboard 3
problems 0
. 0
Well 0
, 0
I 0
started 0
using 0
Google 0
Chrome 0
, 0
which 0
is 0
a 0
little 0
better 0
, 0
but 0
it 0
freezes 0
too 0
sometimes 0
. 0
Also 0
the 0
speakers 3
are 0
not 0
very 0
loud 0
, 0
But 0
it 0
is 0
a 0
netbook 0
. 0
LOVE 0
THIS 0
LAPTOP 0
WONDERFUL 0
PRICE 1
FOR 0
WHAT 0
YOU 0
GET 0
! 0
But 0
, 0
at 0
the 0
same 0
time 0
they 0
the 0
company 0
would 0
not 0
and 0
could 0
not 0
do 0
anything 0
about 0
my 0
problem 0
. 0
Just 0
a 0
black 0
screen 3
! 0
All 0
you 0
have 0
to 0
do 0
is 0
turn 0
it 0
on 0
and 0
it 0
works 0
. 0
A 0
key 0
contributor 0
that 0
led 0
me 0
to 0
Mac 0
is 0
the 0
art 1
aspect 1
. 0
Eventually 0
my 0
battery 3
would 0
n't 0
charge 0
, 0
so 0
unless 0
I 0
had 0
it 0
plugged 0
in 0
it 0
would 0
n't 0
even 0
power 0
on 0
. 0

I 0
have 0
been 0
a 0
PC 0
user 0
since 0
middle 0
school 0
, 0
but 0
in 0
my 0
mid 0
twenties 0
I 0
decided 0

the 0
dark 0
side 0
, 0
or 0
should 0
I 0
say 0
the 0
brighter 0
side 0
of 0
life 0
. 0
Purchased 0

but 0
it 0

turned 0
into 0
my 0

as 0
well 0
for 0
surfing 1
, 0
email 0

had 0
a 0

, 0
i 0
ca 0
n't 0
use 0
it 0
because 0
it 0
is 0
not 0
compatible 0

Accordingly 0
, 0
I 0
have 0
decided 0
to 0
NEVER 0
purchase 0
another 0
HP 0

I 0
know 0
that 0
everyone 0
thinks 0
Macs 0
are 0
overpriced 0
and 0
overrated 0
, 0
but 0
once 0
you 0
get 0
past 0
the 0
initial 0
expense 3
you 0
'll 0
find 0
that 0
they 0
're 0
worth 0
every 0
penny 0
besides 0
, 0
there 0
's 0
always 0
the 0

can 0
attest 0
to 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
this 0

the 0
perfect 0

It 0
takes 0
me 0
approximately 0
3 0
tries 0
to 0
get 0

, 0
then 0
after 0

actually 0
works 0
. 0
Take 0
the 0
simple 0
, 0
easy 0
solution 0
to 0
your 0

problems 0
and 0
stop 0
waiting 0

smacking 0
your 0
old 0

around 0

It 0
is 0
as 0
good 0
as 0
new 0
. 0
And 0
it 0
did 0
n't 0
show 0
up 0
on 0
the 0
reciept 0
, 0
I 0
do 0
n't 0
know 0
how 0
we 0

I 0
went 0
from 0
BestBuy 0

Back 0
then 0
my 0
entire 0
family 0
was 0
Devoted 0
to 0
the 0
Sony 0
name 0
. 0
When 0
I 0
got 0
my 0
laptop 0
back 0
after 0
this 0
first 0
instance 0
it 0
worked 0
okay 0
for 0
a 0
little 0
bit 0
then 0
I 0
started 0
expeirencing 0
issues 0
again 0
, 0
everything 0
from 0

and 0
just 0
all 0

of 0

Love 0
that 0
it 0
does 0
n't 0
take 0
up 0
space 1
like 0
a 0

. 0
3 0
weeks 0
after 0
giving 0
the 0

for 0
repairVisited 0
MacHouse 0
Amsterdam 0
. 0
They 0
do 0
n't 0
seem 0
to 0
be 0
susceptible 0
to 0
viruses 0
, 0
which 0
is 0
one 0
less 0
big 0
thing 0
to 0
worry 0
about 0
when 0
it 0
comes 0
to 0
computers 0
. 0
I 0
was 0
very 0
excited 0
because 0
this 0
was 0
my 0
first 0
personal 0
computer 0
and 0
I 0
was 0
purchasing 0
it 0
with 0
my 0
OWN 0

I 0
had 0
recieved 0
from 0
graduation 0

So 0
, 0
I 0
took 0
it 0
back 0

fixed 0
it 0
by 0
resetting 0
the 0

at 0

up 2
. 0
I 0
can 0
not 0
even 0
imaging 0
going 0
back 0
to 0
a 0
PC 0
after 0
using 0
this 0
wonderful 0
computer 0
. 0
Basic 0
computer 0
. 0
I 0
fell 0
in 0
love 0
with 0
the 0
hp 0
pavillion 0
and 0
that 0
was 0
my 0
replacement 0
and 0
now 0
I 0
could 0
not 0
imagine 0
going 0
back 0
to 0
an 0
acer 0
at 0
all 0
. 0
It 0
turns 0
out 0
that 0
this 0
hp 0
pc 0
had 0
been 0
preciously 0
sold 0
by 0
Wal 0
Mart 0
. 0
I 0
would 0
totally 0
recommend 0
any 0
other 0
laptop 0
over 0
this 0
pile 0
of 0
grabage 0
. 0
I 0
managed 0
to 0
comply 0
with 0
these 0
too 0
and 0
now 0
have 0
to 0
wait 0
and 0
see 0
if 0
they 0
can 0
find 0
another 0
way 0
to 0
screw 0
me 0
. 0
I 0
should 0
have 0
bought 0
one 0
a 0
long 0
time 0
ago 0
. 0
I 0
looked 0
at 0
the 0
computer 0
and 0
it 0
said 0
updating 0
but 0
the 0
asked 0
for 0
a 0
product 0
key 0
. 0
I 0
got 0
what 0
I 0
paid 0
for 0
. 0
Just 0
keep 0
in 0
mind 0
the 0
graphics 0
is 0
not 0
dedicated 0
so 0
loading 0
the 0
movie 0
almost 0
took 0
a 0
minute 0
, 0
but 0
it 0
ran 0
fairly 0
smooth 0
for 0
a 0
nondedicated 0

However 0
I 0
dealt 0
with 0
this 0
problem 0
for 0
over 0
a 0

it 0
was 0

I 0
am 0
really 0

said 0
this 0
performs 1
a 0

better 0
than 0
any 0

I 0
've 0
had 0
in 0
the 0
past 0
. 0
It 0
has 0
been 0
nothing 0
but 0
trouble 0
from 0
the 0
time 0
we 0
bought 0
it 0
. 0
After 0
doing 0
extensive 0
research 0
, 0
macconnection 0
had 0
the 0
lowest 0
price 1
on 0
the 0

am 0
ADDICTED 0

The 0
operating 1

user 1
interface 1

very 0
intuitive 0

and 0
the 0
large 0
multitouch 1
track 1
pad 1
is 0
amazing 0
. 0
So 0
, 0
I 0
went 0
back 0
. 0
I 0
like 0
it 0
so 0
much 0
, 0
I 0
bought 0
another 0
just 0
for 0
my 0
wife 0
. 0
I 0
took 0
it 0
back 0
to 0
the 0
store 0
and 0
exchanged 0
it 0
for 0
another 0
one 0
. 0
All 0
in 0
all 0
great 0
item 0
highly 0
recommend 0
it 0
. 0
It 0
is 0
extremely 0
portable 0
and 0
easily 0
connects 1

elsewhere 0
. 0
I 0
do 0
n't 0
have 0
that 0
additional 0
money 0
right 0
now 0
, 0
and 0
therefore 0
would 0
n't 0
have 0
purchased 0
it 0
at 0
this 0
time 0
. 0
First 0
things 0
first 0
, 0
Macbook 0

has 0
many 0
applications 1
to 0
make 0

easier 0
, 0
unlike 0
the 0

And 0
the 0

is 0
absolutely 0
amazing 0

may 0
have 0
too 0
much 0
on 0
the 0

, 0
but 0
after 0
looking 0
, 0
there 0
was 0
plenty 0
of 0
space 1
and 0
that 0
is 0
not 0
the 0
issue 0
. 0
I 0
do 0
n't 0
use 0
my 0
laptop 0
in 0
a 0
way 0
though 0
that 0
needs 0
a 0
long 0
battery 0
life 0
so 0
it 0
's 0
perfect 0
for 0
me 0
. 0
Guess 0
I 0
'll 0
stay 0
away 0
from 0
HP 0
. 0
It 0
is 0
made 0
better 0
, 0
thicker 0
, 0
and 0
all 0
out 0
tough 0
! 0
It 0
was 0
about 0
six 0
months 0
later 0
when 0
the 0
overheating 0
problem 0
started 0
again 0
, 0
to 0
the 0
point 0
it 0
felt 0
like 0
fire 0
on 0
the 0
bottom 0
of 0
the 0
machine 0
! 0
There 0
is 0
a 0
blank 0
lighted 0
screen 0
when 0
I 0
start 0
and 0
that 0
is 0
all 0
. 0
And 0
i 0
would 0
recommend 0
this 0
to 0
anypne 0
looking 0
for 0
a 0
new 0
laptop 0
. 0
But 0
then 0

goes 0
wrong 0
. 0
So 0
far 0
so 0
good 0
with 0
this 0
laptop 0
. 0
i 0
must 0
keep 0
it 0
plugged 0
in 0
at 0
all 0
times 0
because 0
it 0
will 0
not 0
keep 0
a 0
charge 3
for 0
longer 0
than 0

minutes 0
. 0
Avoid 0
this 0
model 0

helping 0
me 0
get 0
work 0
done 0
! 0
They 0
also 0
use 0
two 0
totally 0
different 0
operating 2
systems 2
. 0
They 0
are 0
about 0
the 0
same 0
size 0
keys 2
. 0
I 0
'm 0
definitely 0
not 0
hard 0
on 0
laptops 0
and 0
guarantee 0
100 0
% 0
that 0
no 0
liquid 0
has 0
touched 0
this 0
machine 0
in 0
my 0
presence 0

I 0
waited 0
another 0
month 0
for 0
approval 0
and 0
for 0
them 0
to 0
BUILD 0
me 0
a 0
new 0
laptop 0
. 0
This 0
ai 0
n't 0
it 0
. 0
I 0
was 0
n't 0
really 0
as 0
concerned 0
about 0
portability 0
it 0
's 0
a 0
very 0
large 0
laptop 0
but 0
it 0
's 0
not 0
hard 0
to 0
move 0
around 0
or 0
take 0
on 0
a 0
trip 0
which 0
was 0
a 0
pleasant 0
surprise 0
. 0
The 0
people 0
are 0
frustrating 0
to 0
work 0
with 0
, 0
the 0
product 0
itself 0
is 0
very 0
cheaply 0
made 0
, 0
and 0
the 0
accessories 3
are 0
less 0
than 0
satisfactory 0
. 0
They 0
offer 0
the 0
best 0
warranty 1
in 0
the 0
business 0
, 0
and 0
do 0
n't 0
3rd 0
party 0
it 0
out 0
like 0
Toshiba 0
. 0
The 0
only 0
problems 0
are 0
the 0
sound 3
isnt 0
very 0
loud 0
I 0
have 0
to 0
wear 0
headphones 0
. 0
Again 0
windows 3
based 0
machines 0
were 0
not 0
giving 0
me 0
anything 0
to 0
work 0
with 0
! 0
Finally 0
, 0
I 0
could 0
n't 0
take 0
it 0
anymore 0
and 0
ordered 0
my 0
Apple 0
. 0
I 0
should 0
have 0
kept 0
my 0
big 0
, 0
old 0
HP 0
. 0
i 0
love 0
the 0
size 1
of 0
the 0
computer 0
since 0
i 0
play 0
games 2
on 0
it 0
. 0
I 0
am 0
a 0
wife 0
, 0
mom 0
and 0
a 0
school 0
teacher 0
and 0
a 0
college 0
student 0
. 0
You 0
know 0
, 0
using 0
the 0
computer 0
should 0
be 0
fun 0
, 0
not 0
aggrevation 0
, 0
especially 0
when 0
you 0
are 0
playing 2
games 2
or 0
working 0
with 0
photos 0
. 0
You 0
just 0
get 0
a 0
trial 0
version 0
either 0
way 0
. 0
I 0
'm 0
all 0
for 0
saving 0
money 0
but 0
Dell 0
needs 0
to 0
step 0
it 0
up 0
. 0
There 0
are 0
no 0
viruses 0
or 0
spyware 0
to 0
worry 0
about 0
like 0
on 0
a 0
Windows 3
computer 0
. 0
great 0
machine 0
if 0
you 0
want 0
to 0
drop 0
the 0
cash 0
for 0
one 0
. 0
To 0
be 0
honest 0
i 0
think 0
it 0
was 0
faulty 0
equipment 3
or 0
something 0
but 0
idk 0
. 0
I 0
also 0
love 0
the 0
small 0
, 0
convenient 0
size 1
of 0
my 0
laptop 0
, 0
making 0
it 0
a 0
perfect 0
tool 0
for 0
my 0
academic 0
studies 0
. 0
I 0
never 0
have 0
had 0
a 0
good 0
result 0
with 0
this 0
computer 0
. 0
I 0
love 0
its 0
solid 0
build 1
, 0
light 0
wt 1
and 0
excellent 0
battery 1
life 1
for 0
now 0
. 0
YOU 0
PAY 0
FOR 0
WHAT 0
YOU 0
GET 0
FOR 0
. 0
while 0
about 0
8 0
years 0
ago 0
, 0
I 0
hope 0
that 0
the 0
quality 3
has 0
changed 0
. 0
NO 0
more 0
Lenovo 0
for 0
me 0
. 0
However 0
, 0
a 0
NETBOOK 0
will 0
be 0
a 0
different 0
story 0
. 0
I 0
'm 0
glad 0
I 0
bought 0
this 0
laptop 0
, 0
it 0
was 0
worth 0
the 0
few 0
$ 0
100 0
extra 0
dollars 0
. 0
The 0
difference 0
is 0
it 0
's 0
a 0
whole 0
lot 0
of 0
fun 0
using 0
the 0
laptop 0
now 0
, 0
still 0
learning 0
the 0
Apple 2
navigation 2
, 0
but 0
is 0
fun 0
and 0
comes 0
with 0
a 0
lot 0
of 0
cool 0
apps 1
. 0
I 0
am 0
a 0
full 0
Mac 0
convert 0
now 0
. 0
I 0
highly 0
recommend 0
that 0
you 0
buy 0
this 0
product 0
. 0
Though 0
you 0
get 0
a 0
polite 0
person 0
, 0
you 0
often 0
don 0
t 0
get 0
a 0
solution 0
. 0
I 0
propose 0
that 0
I 0
can 0
just 0
swap 0
the 0
hard 2
drives 2
. 0
It 0
was 0
old 0
but 0
it 0
was 0
not 0
till 0
we 0
bought 0
the 0
Dell 0
did 0
we 0
realize 0
how 0
great 0
it 0
was 0
. 0
The 0
battery 1
holds 0
up 0
well 0
, 0
it 0
's 0
built 1
very 0
solidly 0
, 0
and 0
runs 1
fast 0
. 0
Sound 3
card 3
is 0
limited 0
though 0
. 0
I 0
initially 0
purchased 0
my 0
Macbook 0
Pro 0
13 0
in 0
April 0
, 0
and 0
I 0
loved 0
it 0
. 0
This 0
is 0
a 0
nicely 0
sized 1
laptop 0
with 0
lots 0
of 0
processing 1
power 1
and 0
long 0
battery 1
life 1
. 0
After 0
much 0
battling 0
with 0
HP 0
i 0
was 0
able 0
to 0
return 0
it 0
4 0
times 0
for 0
repairs 0
. 0
So 0
, 0
you 0
can 0
imagine 0
how 0
unhappy 0
I 0
am 0
with 0
this 0
item 0
. 0
But 0
let 0
me 0
tell 0
you 0
, 0
the 0
mac 0
book 0
pro 0
is 0
so 0
professional 0
. 0
go 0
for 0
it 0
! 0
I 0
highly 0
recommend 0
this 0
computer 0
for 0
students 0
looking 0
for 0
a 0
solid 0
machine 0
to 0
get 0
them 0
through 0
college 0
. 0
The 0
keyboard 0
, 0
which 0
generally 0
felt 0
okay 0
even 0
for 0
someone 0
used 0
to 0
a 0
desktop 2
keyboard 2
, 0
now 0
looks 0
terrible 0
. 0
The 0
display 1
is 0
awesome 0
. 0
After 0
years 0
of 0
occasionally 0
pulling 0
my 0
hair 0
out 0
fighting 0
computer 0
viruses 0
, 0
a 0
good 0
friend 0
convinced 0
me 0
it 0
was 0
time 0
to 0
go 0
the 0
Apple 0
route 0
. 0
However 0
, 0
this 0
laptop 0
has 0
a 0
fatal 0
flaw 0
that 0
i 0
discovered 0
merely 0
a 0
week 0
after 0
buying 0
it 0
. 0
Perfect 0
trifecta 0
! 0
The 0
keyboard 2
is 0
like 0
no 0
other 0
laptop 0
keyboard 2
. 0
Computer 0
crashed 0
frequently 0
and 0
battery 3
life 3
decreased 0
very 0
quickly 0
. 0
So 0
do 0
n't 0
get 0
it 0
. 0
it 0
was 0
a 0
tough 0
choice 0
. 0
They 0
sent 0
it 0
off 0
and 0
within 0
2 0
weeks 0
I 0
had 0
it 0
back 0
good 0
as 0
new 0
. 0
The 0
Awesomest 0
of 0
the 0
awesomest 0
. 0
One 0
, 0
owning 0
a 0
mac 0
is 0
essentially 0
a 0
full 0
production 0
studio 0
in 0
the 0
case 0
of 0
a 0
mac 0
book 0
a 0
portable 0
version 0
. 0
I 0
would 0
like 0
to 0
tell 0
you 0
about 0
the 0
best 0
laptop 0
I 0
just 0
got 0
from 0
Mac 0
. 0
I 0
'm 0
glad 0
it 0
waited 0
, 0
this 0
one 0
is 0
great 0
. 0
I 0
called 0
their 0
repair 2
depot 2
as 0
was 0
told 0
they 0
would 0
send 0
Me 0
a 0
new 0
box 0
to 0
return 0
the 0
computer 0
to 0
the 0
repair 2
depot 2
. 0
For 0
those 0
old 0
enough 0
to 0
remember 0
, 0
it 0
is 0
similar 0
to 0
Beta 0
versus 0
VHS 0
. 0
It 0
's 0
also 0
fairly 0
easy 0
to 0
use 0
the 0
Operating 1
System 1
. 0
But 0
, 0
I 0
would 0
recommend 0
this 0
product 0
. 0
I 0
know 0
that 0
ASUS 0
is 0
known 0
for 0
making 0
motherboards 0
, 0
but 0
this 0
is 0
the 0
worst 0
computer 0
experience 0
that 0
I 0
have 0
ever 0
had 0
. 0
If 0
so 0
, 0
you 0
may 0
be 0
having 0
similar 0
problems 0
. 0
Some 0
days 0
it 0
's 0
just 0
blurry 0
, 0
some 0
days 0
it 0
appears 0
that 0
it 0
's 0
raining 0
on 0
my 0
nice 0
desktop 0
background 0
of 0
a 0
lake 0
and 0
mountains 0
. 0
This 0
is 0
a 0
great 0
machine 0
! 0
This 0
is 0
my 0
first 0
personal 0
Satellite 0
purchase 0
but 0
had 0
very 0
good 0
experience 0
through 0
previous 0
Satellite 0
work 0
issued 0
laptops 0
. 0
We 0
figure 0
that 0
after 0
everything 0
HIS 0
pc 0
actually 0
ended 0
up 0
costing 3
$ 0
350 0
more 0
than 0
my 0
original 0
Mac 0
. 0
Peformance 1
is 0
good 0
for 0
the 0
price 1
. 0
And 0
Toshiba 0
is 0
totally 0
unconcerned 0
. 0
Summary 0
: 0
HP 0
knew 0
they 0
were 0
shipping 0
out 0
bad 0
BIOS 3
and 0
did 0
nothing 0
proactive 0
to 0
resolve 0
it 0
. 0
And 0
in 0
6 0
months 0
, 0
there 0
have 0
been 0
no 0

up 0

any 0

I 0
had 0
3 0
months 0
when 0
the 0
ports 3
started 0
going 0
out 0

think 0
i 0
would 0
spend 0
little 0
extra 0
to 0
get 0
a 0
better 0
made 0
laptop 0

The 0
improvements 0
to 0
the 0
OS 1
have 0
been 0
relatively 0
gradual 0
, 0

substantive 0
. 0
I 0
'll 0
wait 0
and 0
save 0
up 0
for 0
a 0
new 0
one 0
. 0
This 0
laptop 0
does 0
everything 0
I 0
need 0
it 0
to 0
very 0
well 0
. 0
They 0
are 0
not 0
. 0
It 0
makes 0
sorting 0
out 0
all 0

A 0

When 0
I 0
started 0
worrying 0
for 0
not 0
hearing 0
anything 0
from 0
them 0
, 0
I 0
tried 0
to 0
call 0
. 0
I 0
think 0
the 0
manual 2
is 0
somewhere 0
on 0
the 0
hard 2
drive 2
, 0
but 0
I 0
rather 0
have 0
a 0
hard 0
copy 0
. 0
got 0
another 0
1 0
, 0
and 0
same 0
issue 0
. 0
They 0
were 0
able 0
to 0
setup 0
with 0
labtops 0
themselves 0
within 0
a 0
few 0
minutes 0
. 0
I 0
consider 0
myself 0
an 0
average 0
user 0
and 0
this 0
computer 0
serves 0
my 0
need 0
. 0
Adjust 0
the 0
sensitivity 3
since 0
it 0
's 0
not 0
that 0
responsive 0
to 0
begin 0
with 0
. 0
After 0
a 0
couple 0
of 0
years 0
, 0
my 0
battery 3
life 0
began 0
to 0
diminish 0
but 0
was 0
replaced 0
for 0
free 0
due 0
to 0
a 0
companywide 0
recall 0
of 0
my 0
particular 0
battery 3
. 0
The 0
system 3
constantly 0
overheats 0
, 0
the 0
battery 3
life 3
is 0
too 0
short 0
, 0
the 0
case 3
is 0
coming 0
apart 0
, 0
and 0
my 0
core 3
applications 3
that 0
I 0
use 0
every 0
day 0
in 0
my 0
work 0
as 0
a 0
graphic 0
artist 0
run 0
poorly 0
. 0
Later 0
it 0
held 0
zero 0
charge 3
and 0
its 0
replacement 0
worked 0
for 0
less 0
than 0
three 0
months 0
. 0
The 0
company 0
sent 0
me 0
a 0
whole 0
new 0
cord 1
overnight 0
and 0
apologized 0
. 0
It 0
's 0
even 0
easy 0
to 0
hook 1
up 1
to 1
other 1
wireless 1
networks 1
. 0
Also 0
, 0
I 0
have 0
had 0
alot 0
of 0
trouble 0
with 0
the 0
shift 3
key 3
to 0
go 0
to 0
other 0
lines 0
. 0
The 0
rep 3
did 0
not 0
even 0
answer 0
my 0
question 0
, 0
I 0
had 0
to 0
ask 0
him 0
, 0
if 0
he 0
understood 0
what 0
I 0
ask 0
or 0
if 0
he 0
spoke 0
english 0
because 0
he 0
did 0
n't 0
even 0
try 0
to 0
acknowledge 0
my 0
question 0
. 0
I 0
am 0
now 0
frustrated 0
that 0
I 0
still 0
have 0
to 0
use 0
my 0
work 0
issued 0
Windows 0
laptop 0
! 0
It 0
gives 0
me 0
the 0
power 1
and 0
speed 1
that 0
I 0
need 0
to 0
run 0
all 0
the 0
programs 2
I 0
use 0
to 0
edit 0
. 0
iLife 1
is 0
easily 0
compatible 0
with 0
Microsoft 2
Office 2
so 0
you 0
can 0
send 0
and 0
receive 0
files 0
from 0
a 0
PC 0
. 0
They 0
do 0
n't 0
crash 0
. 0
As 0
a 0
computer 0
science 0
student 0
in 0
college 0
, 0
I 0
find 0
that 0
the 0
portability 1
, 0
longevity 1
, 0
and 0
ease 0
of 0
use 1
of 0
this 0
computer 0
make 0
me 0
shockingly 0
want 0
to 0
do 0
homework 0
more 0
; 0
This 0
Notebook 0
restarts 0
every 0
time 0
there 0
is 0
a 0
new 0
update 0
, 0
so 0
if 0
you 0
do 0
n't 0
save 0
your 0
files 0
and 0
information 0
, 0
everything 0
will 0
be 0
lost 0
. 0
I 0
love 0
this 0
little 0
one 0
. 0
So 0
not 0
having 0
my 0
laptop 0
was 0
discouraging 0
. 0
Again 0
I 0
sent 0
it 0
back 0
and 0
they 0
replaced 0
the 0
motherboard 2
and 0
some 0
fan 2
inside 0
. 0
Fully 0
charged 1
, 0
the 0
MacBook 0
Pro 0
can 0
last 0
about 0
five 0
hours 0
unplugged 0
. 0
It 0
was 0
a 0
hard 0
decision 0
for 0
me 0
since 0
the 0
MacBook 0
Pro 0
looked 0
so 0
appealing 0
. 0
1st 0
hand 0
experience 0
is 0
very 0
important 0
, 0
especially 0
for 0
a 0
new 0
customer 0
. 0
I 0
especially 0
appreciate 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
it 0
has 0
almost 0
zero 0
viruses 0
and 0
spyware 0
problems 0
! 0
Even 0
though 0
it 0
is 0
much 0
more 0
expensive 0
than 0
many 0
PC 0
laptops 0
, 0
it 0
is 0
worth 0
the 0
price 0
. 0
I 0
know 0
there 0
are 0
way 0
better 0
laptops 0
out 0
there 0
for 0
the 0
same 0
price 2
, 0
and 0
why 0
spend 0
money 0
on 0
shit 0
when 0
you 0
can 0
go 0
out 0
and 0
get 0
yourself 0
a 0
perfectly 0
decent 0
laptop 0
that 0
doesnt 0
suck 0
total 0
monkey 0
balls 0
. 0
I 0
do 0
n't 0
like 0
this 0
company 0
nor 0
the 0
toshiba 0
brand 0
, 0
and 0
I 0
'll 0
never 0
buy 0
another 0
one 0
because 0
I 0
've 0
put 0
more 0
into 0
it 0
then 0
it 0
is 0
worth 0
. 0
ca 0
n't 0
reinstall 0
with 0
standard 3
os 3
cd 3
because 0
of 0
proprietary 3
hardware 3
drivers 3
. 0
However 0
, 0
this 0
will 0
be 0
my 0
last 0
as 0
well 0
. 0
There 0
is 0
a 0
small 0
red 0
circle 0
next 0
to 0
it 0
with 0
a 0
x 0
in 0
the 0
middle 0
, 0
and 0
when 0
I 0
click 0
on 0
it 0
it 0
says 0
: 0
Consider 0
replacing 0
your 0
battery 2
and 0
it 0
does 0
not 0
hold 0
full 0
charge 3
. 0
SO 0
? 0
HOW 0
CAN 0
YOU 0
SOLVE 0
IT 0
? 0
C'mon 0
, 0
I 0
just 0
bought 0
the 0
netbook 0
2 0
weeks 0
ago 0
. 0
The 0
computer 0
was 0
two 0
weeks 0
late 0
in 0
delivery 3
because 0
HP 0
forgot 0
to 0
complete 0
the 0
required 0
import 0
paperwork 0
. 0
If 0
you 0
're 0
looking 0
for 0
a 0
great 0
laptop 0
, 0
you 0
've 0
found 0
the 0
best 0
here 0
. 0
The 0
first 0
programm 2
I 0
switched 0
on 0
was 0
a 0
game 0
for 0
my 0
children 0
. 0
I 0
have 0
been 0
very 0
pleased 0
with 0
the 0
performance 1
of 0
this 0
laptop 0
. 0
I 0
have 0
had 0
my 0
MacBook 0
for 0
almost 0
6 0
months 0
and 0
can 0
honestly 0
say 0
that 0
I 0
will 0
NEVER 0
buy 0
another 0
computer 0
if 0
it 0
is 0
not 0
a 0
Mac 0
. 0
I 0
've 0
always 0
owned 0
a 0
PC 0
and 0
decided 0
to 0
try 0
a 0
MacBook 0
to 0
see 0
what 0
it 0
's 0
all 0
about 0
. 0
On 0
two 0
occasions 0
the 0
computer 0
s 0
calendar 0
told 0
me 0
it 0
was 0
1969 0
. 0
Its 0
very 0
nice 0
and 0
once 0
you 0
learn 0
the 0
features 2
you 0
will 0
be 0
so 0
happy 0
to 0
have 0
such 0
a 0
sophisticated 0
computer 0
. 0
Overall 0
, 0
this 0
is 0
a 0
wonderful 0
computer 0
and 0
definitly 0
worth 0
the 0
purchase 0
! 0
It 0
came 0
alot 0
faster 0
than 0
I 0
thought 0
it 0
would 0
have 0
which 0
was 0
really 0
exciting 0
. 0
Then 0
to 0
make 0
matters 0
worst 0
, 0
there 0
is 0
noone 0
that 0
they 0
can 0
transfer 0
you 0
to 0
. 0
It 0
is 0
sleek 0
and 0
lightweight 0
and 0
charges 1
quickly 0
when 0
needed 0
. 0
also 0
you 0
may 0
need 0
to 0
charge 2
it 0
once 0
a 0
day 0
, 0
if 0
for 0
medium 0
use 0
every 0
thing 0
fast 0
and 0
easy 0
with 0
mac 0
the 0
size 1
and 0
look 1
is 0
the 0
most 0
feature 1
that 0
attracted 0
me 0
to 0
it 0
. 0
But 0
if 0
you 0
are 0
in 0
the 0
computer 0
field 0
you 0
probably 0
would 0
n't 0
be 0
here 0
. 0
The 0
great 0
18 0
month 0
same 0
as 0
cash 0
financing 0
and 0
Advance 0
Protection 0
Plan 0
which 0
includes 0
accidents 0
like 0

. 0
I 0
could 0
not 0
handle 0
it 0
one 0
hand 0
like 0
I 0
can 0
the 0
replacement 0
computer 0
I 0
purchased 0
. 0
The 0
new 0
Macbook 0
Pro 0
15 0
inch 0
i7 0
is 0
nothing 0
short 0
of 0
amazing 0
. 0
i 0
would 0
never 0
go 0
back 0
any 0
more 0
, 0
i 0
love 0
this 0
computer 0
so 0
much 0
and 0
i 0
would 0
recommend 0
it 0
to 0
everyone 0
. 0
they 0
respond 0
: 0
your 0
dissatisfaction 0
is 0
noted 0
. 0
I 0
was 0
even 0
able 0
to 0
uninstall 0
McAffe 0
and 0
install 0
one 0
of 0
my 0
Symantec 0
licenses 0
with 0
a 0
no 0
issues 0
whatsoever 0
. 0
The 0
iBook 2
backup 2
also 0
uses 0
a 0
firewire 2
connection 2
. 0
I 0
did 0
think 0
it 0
had 0
a 0
camera 2
because 0
that 0
was 0
one 0
of 0
my 0
requirements 0
, 0
but 0
forgot 0
to 0
check 0
in 0
the 0
specifications 2
on 0
this 0
one 0
before 0
I 0
purchased 0
. 0
Also 0
the 0
display 1
is 0
exceptional 0
! 0
This 0
is 0
basically 0
the 0
best 0
laptop 0
I 0
have 0
ever 0
had 0
or 0
used 0
. 0
3DMARK6 0
score 0
is 0
only 0

I 0
tell 0
everyone 0
I 0
see 0
out 0
looking 0
to 0
get 0
this 0
or 0
another 0
Toshiba 0
. 0
So 0
honestly 0
, 0
I 0
was 0
n't 0
expecting 0
anything 0
less 0
than 0
perfection 0
, 0
and 0
I 0
was 0
n't 0
disappointed 0
. 0
Learning 0
all 0
of 0
the 0
keyboard 1
shortcuts 1
only 0
took 0
a 0
few 0
minutes 0
to 0
get 0
used 0
to 0
as 0
some 0
of 0
the 0
shortcuts 2
are 0
the 0
same 0
on 0
Windows 0
machines 0

little 0
short 0
on 0
RAM 3
but 0
you 0
get 0
what 0
you 0
pay 0
for 0

It 0
did 0
n't 0
come 0
with 0
any 0
software 3
installed 0
outside 0
of 0

for 0
the 0
price 1

I 0
was 0
very 0
pleased 0
with 0
the 0
condition 0

the 0
overall 0

a 0
seventeen 0
