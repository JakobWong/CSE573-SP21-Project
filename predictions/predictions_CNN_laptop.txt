that 0

I 0
only 0

once 0

But 0
probably 0
my 0

a 0

defective 0
. 0
And 0
if 0
you 0
are 0
switching 0
from 0

I 0
hilghy 0
sugest 0
this 0
one 0
. 0
It 0
is 0
super 0
fast 0

But 0
the 0
mountain 0

just 0
too 0
slow 0

which 0
really 0

The 0

it 0
's 0
so 0
quiet 0
that 0
I 0
do 0
n't 0
hear 0
it 0
at 0
all 0
. 0
Its 0
size 1
is 0
ideal 0
and 0
the 0
weight 0
is 0
acceptable 0
. 0
I 0
know 0
Apples 0
are 0
more 0
expensive 0
than 0
PCs 0
, 0
but 0
he 0
thinks 0
it 0
is 0
worth 0
every 0
penny 0
. 0
To 0
me 0
it 0
's 0
a 0
workhorse 0
and 0
quiet 0
as 0
can 0
be 0
you 0
even 0
save 0

'm 0
pretty 0

my 0

Thank 0
you 0
so 0
much 0
for 0
the 0

item 0
. 0
This 0

only 0
2 0
USB 3
ports 2
, 0
and 0
they 0
are 0
both 0
on 0
the 0

side 0

It 0
's 0
annoying 0
very 0
much 0
and 0
I 0
wo 0
n't 0
ever 0
buy 0
any 0
Acer 0
products 0
. 0
This 0
is 0
why 0
I 0
purchased 0
a 0
BRAND 0
NEW 0
LAPTOP 0
in 0
the 0
first 0
place 0
so 0
it 0
would 0
n't 0
have 0
ANY 0
problems 0
. 0
It 0
has 0
so 0
much 0
more 0
speed 1
and 0
the 0
screen 3
is 0
very 0
sharp 0
. 0
As 0
for 0
the 0
laptop 0
, 0
this 0
is 0
our 0
3rd 0
Apple 0
computer 0
in 0
the 0
past 0
2 0
years 0
. 0
Everything 0
I 0
wanted 0
and 0
everything 0
I 0
needed 0
and 0
the 0
price 1
was 0
great 0
! 0
It 0
's 0
not 0
inexpensive 0
but 0
the 0
Hardware 1
performance 1
is 0
impressive 0
for 0
a 0
computer 0
this 0
small 0
. 0
It 0
is 0
better 0
than 0
my 0
old 0
acer 0
laptop 0
. 0
This 0
thing 0
is 0
awesome 0
, 0
everything 0
always 0
works 1
, 0
everything 0
is 0
always 0
easy 0
to 0
set 1
up 1
, 0
everything 0
is 0
compatible 0
, 0
its 0
literally 0
everything 0
I 0
could 0
ask 0
for 0
. 0
I 0
would 0
buy 0
it 0
again 0
in 0
a 0
heartbeat 0
! 0
Keyboard 1
responds 0
well 0
to 0
presses 0
. 0
If 0
someone 0
called 0
me 0
an 0
Apple 0
Fanboyit 0
would 0
make 0
sense. 0
. 0
Lastly 0
, 0
Windows 1

is 0
annoying 0
. 0
A 0
scratch 0
on 0
a 0
$ 0
1,500 0
MacBook 0
is 0
unforgivable 0
. 0
I 0
just 0
fell 0
in 0

with 0
this 0
thing 0
. 0
Everything 0
is 0
so 0
easy 0
and 0
intuitive 0
to 0

. 0
I 0
have 0
no 0
problems 0
yet 0
on 0
my 0
mac 0
so 0
far 0
, 0
and 0
hope 0
it 0
stays 0
like 0
that 0
. 0
This 0
laptop 0
is 0
a 0

. 0
Biggest 0
complaint 0
is 0
Windows 1

Only 0

. 0
It 0
has 0
been 0
to 0
early 0
to 0
see 0
if 0
this 0
actually 0
fixes 0
the 0
problem 0
or 0
not 0
though 0
. 0
This 0
device 0
has 0
met 0
my 0
expectations 0
and 0
I 0
'm 0
sure 0
it 0
will 0
meet 0
yours 0
. 0
It 0
has 0
all 0
the 0
expected 0
features 1
and 0
more 0
plus 0
a 0
wide 0
screen 1
and 0
more 0
than 0

. 0
Out 0
of 0
all 0
the 0

I 0
have 0
owned 0
, 0
this 0
is 0
by 0

the 0
best 0
! 0
Amazing 0
Performance 0
for 0
anything 0
I 0
throw 0
at 0
it 0
. 0
I 0
can 0
never 0
go 0
back 0
to 0
a 0
PC 0
now 0
, 0
this 0
machine 0
never 0
freezes 0
or 0
has 0
any 0
problems 0
. 0
Out 0
of 0
the 0
box 0
I 0
noticed 0
how 0
small 0
it 0
was 0
and 0
was 0
exactly 0
what 0
I 0
was 0
looking 0
for 0
. 0
The 0
receiver 1
was 0
full 0
of 0
superlatives 0
for 0
the 0
quality 0
and 0
performance 1
. 0
I 0
was 0
extremely 0
happy 0
with 0
the 0
OS 1
itself 0
. 0
I 0
was 0
looking 0
for 0
something 0
in 0
between 0
a 0
regular 0
laptop 0
and 0
a 0
tablet 0
and 0
this 0
is 0
it 0
. 0
The 0
new 0
MBP 0
offers 0
great 0
portability 0
and 0
gives 0
us 0
confidence 0
that 0
we 0
are 0
not 0
going 0
to 0
need 0
to 0
purchase 0
a 0
new 0
laptop 0
in 0
18 0
months 0
. 0
Great 0
purchase 0
and 0
I 0
definitely 0
did 0
n't 0
miss 0
out 0
on 0
the 0
Black 0

The 0
criticism 0
has 0
waned 0

and 0
now 0
I 0
'd 0
be 0
the 0
first 0
to 0
recommend 0
an 0
Air 0

truly 0
portable 0

I 0
would 0
have 0
given 0
it 0
5 0

fact 0
that 0

the 0

the 0

and 0
whether 0
to 0
spring 0
for 0
the 0

was 0
a 0
significantly 0
more 0
affordable 0
than 0
getting 0
a 0

from 0
Apple 0
. 0
The 0
reason 0
why 0
I 0
choose 0
apple 0
MacBook 0
because 0
of 0
their 0
design 1
and 0
the 0
aluminum 0

give 0
Mac 0
Book 0

try 0
. 0
Set 0
up 0
was 0
a 0
breeze 0

But 0
I 0
do 0
NOT 0
like 0
Win8 0
. 0
I 0
am 0
still 0
in 0
the 0
process 0
of 0
learning 0
about 0
its 0
features 1
. 0
I 0
had 0
the 0
same 0
reasons 0
as 0
most 0
PC 0
users 0
: 0
the 0
price 1
, 0
the 0
overbearing 0
restrictions 0
of 0
OSX 1
and 0
lack 0
of 0
support 3
for 0
games 2
. 0
I 0
wanted 0
it 0
for 0
it 0
's 0
mobility 0
and 0
man 0
, 0
this 0
little 0
bad 0
boy 0
is 0
very 0
nice 0
. 0
Seems 0
to 0
me 0
that 0
's 0
the 0
best 0
way 0
to 0
get 0
Apple 0
's 0
attention 0
. 0
Very 0
nice 0
so 0
far 0
. 0
You 0
wo 0
n't 0
be 0
disappointed 0
. 0
The 0
investment 0
of 0
a 0
new 0
MacBook 0
Pro 0
came 0
at 0
a 0
price 0
, 0
but 0
totally 0
worth 0
it 0
for 0
a 0
good 0
piece 0
of 0
mind 0
. 0
I 0
found 0
the 0
mini 0
to 0
be 0
: 0
Exceptionally 0
easy 0
to 0
set 0
up 0
Having 0
USB3 3
is 0
why 0
I 0
bought 0
this 0
Mini 0
. 0
Be 0
sure 0
to 0
have 0
good 0
air 0
flow 0
where 0
ever 0
you 0
put 0
it 0
. 0
The 0
sound 3
is 0
nice 0
and 0
loud 0
; 0
I 0
do 0
n't 0
have 0
any 0
problems 0
with 0
hearing 0
anything 0
. 0
It 0
is 0
very 0
slim 0
, 0
the 0
track 1
pad 3
is 0
very 0
much 0
impressed 0
with 0
me 0
. 0
This 0
was 0
the 0
same 0
problem 0
with 0
my 0
MacBook 0
circa 0
2007 0
that 0
I 0
just 0
retired 0
. 0
Great 0
things 0
come 0
in 0
small 0
packages 0

HUGE 0
Apple 0
MAC 0
Fan 0
! 0
Looked 0
at 0
HP 0
, 0
ASUS 1
, 0
Acer 0
, 0
Sony 0
and 0
a 0
bunch 0
of 0
other 0
ones 0
but 0
could 0
not 0
find 0
I 0
really 0
liked 0
. 0
The 0
settings 3
are 0
not 0
userfriendly 0
either 0
. 0
Honestly 0
, 0
I 0
am 0
surprised 0
no 0
one 0
else 0
has 0
mentioned 0
returning 0
theirs 0
. 0
Most 0
of 0
them 0
were 0
either 0
too 0
big 0
, 0
too 0
noisy 0
and 0
too 0
slow 0
after 0
2 0
years 0
. 0
The 0
machine 0
is 0
used 0
, 0
but 0
is 0
like 0
new 0
, 0
i 0
'm 0
very 0
impress 0

Thank 0

for 0
OpenOffice 0

Awesome 0
form 1

, 0
great 0
battery 1
life 1
, 0
wonderful 0
UX 0
. 0
Needless 0
to 0
say 0
, 0
the 0
leap 0
from 0
that 0
to 0
this 0
has 0
been 0
amazing 0
and 0
aside 0
from 0
the 0
financial 0
reasons 0
I 0
am 0
astounded 0
that 0
I 0
had 0
n't 0
made 0
the 0
switch 0
sooner 0
. 0
Its 0
perfect 0
, 0
not 0
much 0
heavy 0
. 0
i 0
love 0
the 0
keyboard 1
and 0
the 0
screen 1
. 0
I 0
find 0
it 0
not 0
to 0
be 0
very 0
user 0
friendly 0
. 0
It 0
has 0
surpassed 0
all 0
expectations 0
and 0
fulfilled 0
all 0
my 0
needs 0
. 0
However 0
, 0
there 0
are 0
MAJOR 0
issues 0
with 0
the 0
touchpad 3
which 0
render 0
the 0
device 3
nearly 0
useless 0
. 0
What 0
angers 0
me 0
more 0
than 0
anything 0
else 0
is 0
that 0
I 0
spent 0
all 0
those 0
years 0
hating 0
MACs 0
when 0
I 0
could 0
have 0
been 0
getting 0
a 0
lot 0
more 0
production 0
with 0
a 0
whole 0
lot 0
less 0
grief 0
! 0
I 0
've 0
already 0
upgraded 0
o 0
Mavericks 0
and 0
I 0
am 0
impressed 0
with 0
everything 0
about 0
this 0
computer 0
. 0
So 0
this 0
is 0
very 0
good 0
commputer 0
and 0
i 0
highly 0
suggest 0
it 0
. 0
the 0
mbp 0
i 0
recieved 0
was 0
everything 0
it 0
should 0
have 0
been 0
. 0
Not 0
as 0
fast 0
as 0
I 0
would 0
have 0
expect 0
for 0
an 0
i5 0
. 0
SO 0
of 0
course 0
this 0
one 0
came 0
through 0
with 0
the 0
awesomeness 0
! 0
You 0
will 0
not 0
regret 0
buying 0
this 0
computer 0
! 0
Nothing 0
bad 0
to 0
say 0
about 0
it 0
. 0
It 0
s 0
heavy 0
for 0
Mac 0
book 0
but 0
is 0
good 0
. 0
thanks 0
for 0
great 0
service 1
and 0
shipping 0

Deal 0
of 0
the 0
year 0
. 0
My 0
sisters 0
same 0
laptop 0
broke 0
about 0
the 0
month 0
later 0
for 0
the 0
same 0
reason 0
. 0
Minis 0
make 0
sense 0
for 0
a 0
lot 0
of 0
people 0
. 0
The 0
performance 1
seems 0
quite 0
good 0
, 0
and 0
builtin 1
applications 1
like 0
iPhoto 1
work 0
great 0
with 0
my 0
phone 0
and 0
camera 0
. 0
This 0
Mac 0
Mini 0
makes 0
the 0
Macbook 0
Pro 0
seem 0
slow 0
. 0
I 0
did 0
swap 0
out 0
the 0
hard 3
drive 2
for 0
a 0
Samsung 0
830 0
SSD 0
which 0
I 0
highly 0
recommend 0
. 0
I 0
bought 0
this 0
MacBook 0
Pro 0
to 0
replace 0
my 0
sixyearold 0
PC 0
a 0
Sony 0
Vaio 0
, 0
but 0
it 0
was 0
basically 0
no 0
better 0
than 0
my 0
old 0
PC 0
, 0
so 0
I 0
returned 0
it 0
. 0
I 0
wanted 0
a 0
simple 0
, 0
reliable 0
laptop 0
. 0
Cheaper 0
than 0
buying 0
it 0
@ 0
apple 0
too 0
! 0
I 0
have 0
just 0
had 0
to 0
learn 0
to 0
be 0
a 0
little 0
harder 0
typer 0
than 0
on 0
my 0
last 0
computer 0
. 0
Extremely 0
disappointed 0
with 0
the 0
way 0
it 0
is 0
. 0
Never 0
been 0
happier 0
using 0
computer 0
. 0
I 0
have 0
had 0
a 0
total 0
of 0
5 0
different 0
laptop 0
from 0
many 0
different 0
manufactures 0
. 0
Does 0
everything 0
I 0
wanted 0
this 0
laptop 0
to 0
do 0
. 0
Besides 0
, 0
the 0
apple 0
stocks 0
have 0
been 0
falling 0
due 0
to 0
lack 0
of 0
sales 0
. 0
Turns 0
out 0
this 0
is 0
a 0
common 0
problem 0
. 0
Starts 0
up 0
in 0
a 0
hurry 0
and 0
everything 0
is 0
ready 0
to 0
go 0
. 0
But 0
I 0
'm 0
still 0
learning 0
so 0
ca 0
n't 0
rate 0
it 0
yet 0
for 0
everything 0
. 0
Overall 0
very 0
impressed 0
, 0
Thank 0
you 0
Apple 0
and 0
Amazon 0
! 0
Yes 0
, 0
that 0
's 0
a 0
good 0
thing 0
, 0
but 0
it 0
's 0
made 0
from 0
aluminum 0
that 0
scratches 0
easily 0
. 0
Very 0
fast 0
for 0
my 0
needs 0
. 0
I 0
bought 0
this 0
Mac 0
in 0
order 0
to 0
replace 0
my 0
old 0
Dell 0
laptop 0
. 0
Quick 0
and 0
has 0
built 0
in 0
virus 0
control 3
. 0
Took 0
a 0
long 0
time 0
trying 0
to 0
decide 0
between 0
one 0
with 0
retina 3
display 0
and 0
one 0
without 0
. 0
I 0
saw 0
the 0
Mini 0
Mac 0
at 0
Best 0
Buy 0
and 0
decided 0
to 0
get 0
this 0
as 0
my 0
replacement 0
. 0
I 0
finally 0
decided 0
on 0
this 0
one 0
and 0
could 0
n't 0
be 0
any 0
happier 0
. 0
I 0
was 0
also 0
informed 0
that 0
the 0
components 0
of 0
the 0
Mac 0
Book 0
were 0
dirty 0
. 0
So 0
glad 0
I 0
did 0
not 0
waste 0
money 0
on 0
a 0
less 0
than 0
par 0
product 0
. 0
Have 0
n't 0
regretted 0
it 0
one 0
bit 0
. 0
The 0
one 0
thing 0
that 0
Apple 0
does 0
right 0
is 0
computers 0
. 0
the 0
hardware 3
problems 0
have 0
been 0
so 0
bad 0
, 0
i 0
ca 0
n't 0
wait 0
till 0
it 0
completely 0
dies 0
in 0
3 0
years 0
, 0
TOPS 0
! 0
It 0
's 0
so 0
nice 0
that 0
the 0
battery 3
last 0
so 0
long 0
and 0
that 0
this 0
machine 0
has 0
the 0
snow 0
lion 0
! 0
I 0
think 0
that 0
they 0
are 0
the 0
best 0
out 0
on 0
the 0
market 0
. 0
HOWEVER 0
I 0
chose 0
two 0
day 0
shipping 0
and 0
it 0
took 0
over 0
a 0
week 0
to 0
arrive 1
. 0
That 0
's 0
quite 0
a 0
bump 0
up 0
from 0
the 0
$ 0
599 0
that 0
this 0
little 0
guy 0
sells 0
for 0
, 0
which 0
leaves 0
me 0
to 0
my 0
next 0
point 0
. 0
this 0
is 0
quite 0
smooth 0
as 0
well 0
as 0
heavy 0
and 0
can 0
easily 0
slip 0
through 0
the 0
hands 0
. 0
My 0
laptop 0
is 0
so 0
light 0
that 0
I 0
can 0
take 0
it 0
with 0
me 0
anywhere 0
. 0
it 0
's 0
exactly 0
what 0
i 0
wanted 0
, 0
and 0
it 0
has 0
all 0
the 0
new 0
features 1
and 0
whatnot 0
. 0
You 0
can 0
do 0
absolutely 0
anything 0
and 0
is 0
very 0
fast 0
and 0
stylish 0
. 0
Finally 0
decided 0
to 0
try 0
a 0
MAC 0
because 0
there 0
were 0
too 0
many 0
choices 0
of 0
which 0
PC 0
's 0
to 0
buy 0
and 0
EVERYONE 0
who 0
had 0
a 0
MAC 0
said 0
buy 0
a 0
MAC 0
. 0
Can 0
you 0
buy 0
any 0
laptop 0
that 0
matches 0
the 0
quality 0
of 0
a 0
MacBook 0
? 0
It 0
feels 0
cheap 0
, 0
the 0
keyboard 1
is 0
not 0
very 0
sensitive 0
. 0
That 0
defeated 0
the 0
whole 0
point 0
of 0
a 0
laptop 0
. 0
Though 0
please 0
note 0
that 0
sometimes 0
it 0
crashes 0
, 0
and 0
the 0
sound 3
quality 1
isnt 0
superb 0
. 0
It 0
is 0
very 0
easy 0
to 0
navigate 1
even 0
for 0
a 0
novice 0
. 0
But 0
until 0
now 0
, 0
no 0
complains 0
at 0
all 0
. 0
The 0
cons 0
are 0
more 0
annoyances 0
that 0
can 0
be 0
lived 0
with 0

Does 0
everything 0
I 0
need 0
it 0
to 0

a 0
wonderful 0
battery 1

and 0
I 0
could 0
n't 0
be 0
happier 0

Great 0
Performance 0
and 0
Quality 0

Just 0
What 0
I 0
Needed 0
For 0

I 0
will 0
get 0
used 0
to 0
this 0
new 0

I 0
bought 0
it 0
to 0
my 0
son 0
who 0
uses 0
it 0
for 0
graphic 0
design 1

I 0
previously 0
owned 0
an 0
older 0
Dell 0
laptop 0
that 0
died 0
after 0
about 0
5 0
or 0
6 0
years 0
. 0
Its 0
a 0
pretty 0
decent 0
computer 0
. 0
I 0
never 0
tried 0
any 0
external 2
mics 0
with 0
that 0
iMac 1
. 0
The 0
new 0
os 0
is 0
great 0
on 0
my 0
macbook 0
pro 0
! 0
It 0
was 0
fast 0
, 0
and 0
it 0
was 0
different 0
. 0
I 0
had 0
a 0
little 0
problem 0
adjusting 0
to 0
the 0
small 0
screen 1
but 0
works 0
fine 0
as 0
long 0
as 0
I 0
remember 0
to 0
carry 0
my 0
glasses 0
. 0
I 0
purchased 0
my 0
first 0
Mac 0
and 0
am 0
glad 0
I 0
did 0
. 0

have 0
experienced 0
no 0
problems 0
, 0
works 1
as 0
anticipated 0
. 0
System 3
is 0
running 0
great 0
. 0
Easy 0
to 0
customize 0
setting 0
and 0
even 0
create 0
your 0
own 0
bookmarks 0
. 0
They 0
really 0
screwed 0
the 0
pooch 0
on 0
this 0
one 0
. 0
The 0
MAC 3
Mini 0
, 0
wireless 3
keyboard 1
/ 1
mouse 2
and 0
a 0
HDMI 1
cable 2
is 0
all 0
I 0
need 0
to 0
get 0
some 0
real 0
work 0
done 0
. 0
it 0
has 0
all 0
the 0
features 1
that 0
we 0
expected 0
and 0
the 0
price 1
was 0
good 0
, 0
working 0
well 0
so 0
far 0
. 0
I 0
work 0
as 0
a 0
designer 1
and 0
coder 0
and 0
I 0
needed 0
a 0
new 0
buddy 0
to 0
work 0
with 0
, 0
not 0
gaming 0
. 0
The 0
new 0
operating 1
system 0
makes 0
this 0
computer 0
into 0
a 0
super 0
iPad 0
. 0
I 0
am 0
very 0
happy 0
with 0
my 0
first 0
Mac 0
. 0
Easy 0
to 0
set 0
up 1
and 0
go 0
! 0
I 0
ca 0
n't 0
believe 0
how 0
quiet 0
the 0
hard 3
drive 3
is 0
and 0
how 0
quick 0
this 0
thing 0
boots 0
up 0
. 0
The 0
only 0
issue 0
came 0
when 0
I 0
tried 0
scanning 0
to 0
the 0
mac 0
. 0
The 0
machine 0
is 0
speedy 0
and 0
efficient 0
. 0
I 0
think 0
this 0
is 0
about 0
as 0
good 0
as 0
it 0
gets 0
at 0
anything 0
close 0
to 0
this 0
price 3
point 0
. 0
A 0
big 0
upgrade 0
from 0
my 0
13 0
2006 0
macbook 0
. 0
It 0
's 0
just 0
what 0
we 0
were 0
looking 0
for 0
and 0
it 0
works 1
great 0
. 0
Having 0
a 0
Mac 0
certainly 0
makes 0
life 0
easier 0
. 0
The 0
old 0
unibody 0
macbook 0
pro 0
could 0
fry 0
an 0
egg 0
after 0
a 0
while 0
. 0
It 0
works 1
fine 0
, 0
and 0
all 0
the 0
software 3
seems 0
to 0
run 0
pretty 0
well 0
. 0
For 0
this 0
purpose 0
, 0
it 0
's 0
great 0
. 0
Could 0
n't 0
have 0
asked 0
for 0
more 0
! 0
I 0
'm 0
using 0
this 0
computer 0
for 0
word 2
processing 2
, 0
web 2
browsing 2
, 0
some 0
gaming 2
, 0
and 0
I 0
'm 0
learning 0
programming 0
. 0
It 0
certainly 0
does 0
, 0
but 0
you 0
rarely 0
hear 0
any 0
of 0
your 0
friends 0
with 0
Mac 0
's 0
complain 0
about 0
anything 0
. 0
My 0
wife 0
was 0
so 0
excited 0
to 0
open 0
the 0
box 0
, 0
but 0
quickly 0
came 0
to 0
see 0
that 0
it 0
did 0
not 0
function 0
as 0
it 0
should 0
. 0
I 0
do 0
n't 0
have 0
any 0
technical 0
pearls 0
to 0
share 0
. 0
I 0
wanted 0
a 0
computer 0
that 0
was 0
quite 0
, 0
fast 0
, 0
and 0
that 0
had 0
overall 0
great 0
performance 1
. 0
Apple 1
Help 1
is 0
a 0
mixed 0
bag 2
. 0
All 0
I 0
can 0
say 0
is 0
I 0
am 0
impressed 0
. 0
It 0
suddenly 0
can 0
not 0
work 0
. 0
It 0
did 0
everything 0
we 0
expected 0
! 0
Harddrive 3
was 0
in 0
poor 0
condition 0
, 0
had 0
to 0
replace 0
it 0
. 0
It 0
's 0
a 0
nice 0
little 0
gadget 1
. 0
My 0
only 0
complaint 0
is 0
the 0
total 0
lack 0
of 0
instructions 3
that 0
come 0
with 0
the 0
mac 0
mini 0
. 0
The 0
only 0
task 0
that 0
this 0
computer 0
would 0
not 0
be 0
good 0
enough 0
for 0
would 0
be 0
gaming 0
, 0
otherwise 0
the 0
integrated 0
Intel 3
4000 0
graphics 3
work 0
well 0
for 0
other 0
tasks 0
. 0
It 0
's 0
macbook 0
pro 0
and 0
there 0
is 0
no 0
discusion 0
about 0
it 0
. 0
I 0
'm 0
hoping 0
the 0
rest 0
of 0
the 0
features 1
will 0
be 0
the 0
signature 0
quality 1
of 0
apple 0
. 0
I 0
use 0
it 0
mostly 0
for 0
content 0
creation 0
Audio 0
, 0
video 1
, 0
photo 1
editing 1
and 0
its 0
reliable 0
. 0
It 0
is 0
the 0
best 0
all 0
around 0
Mac 0
. 0
Screen 1
is 0
bright 0
and 0
gorgeous 0
. 0
Also 0
is 0
portable 0
and 0
reliable 0
. 0
The 0
only 0
solution 0
is 0
to 0
turn 0
the 0
brightness 0
down 0
, 0
etc 0
. 0
It 0
is 0
not 0
an 0
easy 0
decision 0
to 0
purchase 0
a 0
used 0
or 0
even 0
good 0
as 0
new 0
laptop 0
but 0
I 0
am 0
very 0
satisfied 0

If 0
you 0
want 0
more 0
information 0
on 0

suggest 0
going 0

This 0
was 0
absolutely 0
annoying 0
! 0
And 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
it 0
comes 0
with 0
an 0
i5 0

up 0

Let 0
me 0
start 0

was 0
highly 0
reluctant 0
to 0
spend 0
so 0
much 0
money 0
on 0

like 0
the 0

for 0
our 0
needs 0

it 0
's 0
perfect 0

it 0
definitely 0
beats 0
my 0
old 0

great 0

I 0
went 0
from 0
a 0

this 0
was 0
a 0
great 0

like 0
the 0

It 0
's 0
great 0
to 0

are 0
noticably 0
less 0
expensive 0
than 0
the 0

This 0
can 0
be 0
annoying 0
at 0
first 0

you 0
just 0
have 0
to 0
train 1
yourself 0
not 0
to 0
to 0
start 3
over 0
so 0
far 0

And 0
mine 0

I 0
sent 0
it 0

I 0
am 0

is 0
perfect 0
for 0

which 0
is 0
mostly 0
why 0
I 0
bought 0
it 0
in 0
the 0
first 0
place 0
. 0
However 0
, 0
the 0
machine 0
itself 0
left 0
a 0
bit 0
to 0
be 0
desired 0

and 0
the 0
entire 0
user 0
experience 0
is 0
very 0
elegant 0
. 0
I 0
spent 0
months 0
looking 0
for 0
a 0
good 0
laptop 0
for 0
me 0
and 0
I 0
finally 0
found 0
it 0
! 0
$ 0

! 0
Excelent 0
performance 1

usability 1
, 0
presentation 1
and 0
time 2

. 0
The 0
smaller 0
size 1
was 0
a 0
bonus 0
because 0
of 0
space 0
restrictions 0
. 0
I 0
blame 0
the 0
Mac 0
OS 1
. 0
But 0
for 0
now 0
, 0
this 0
laptop 0
is 0
still 0
a 0
workhorse 0
. 0
I 0
like 0
the 0
operating 1
system 1
. 0
I 0
wish 0
I 0
would 0
have 0
taken 0
the 0
plunge 0
years 0
ago 0
. 0
I 0
love 0
the 0
form 1
factor 0
. 0
I 0
have 0
n't 0
used 0
the 0
product 0
long 0
enough 0
to 0
write 0
a 0
detailed 0
technical 3
review 0
. 0
It 0
's 0
fast 0
at 0
loading 0
the 0
internet 2

So 0
much 0
faster 0
and 0
sleeker 0
looking 0
. 0
I 0
plan 0
on 0
using 0
my 0
MacBook 0
Pro 0
for 0
a 0
long 0
time 0
. 0
Unfortunately 0
, 0
it 0
runs 1
XP 3

Microsoft 2
is 0
dropping 0
support 2
next 0
April 0
. 0
Its 0
seen 0
in 0
movies 0

prominent 0
important 0
people 0
carry 1

use 0
them 0

they 0
are 0
GREAT 0

First 0
off 0
, 0
I 0
really 0
do 0
like 0
my 0
MBP 0

OS 1
it 0
is 0
pretty 0
easy 0
to 0
get 0
around 0
, 0
and 0
the 0
overall 0
build 1
is 0
great 0
eg 0
the 0
keyboard 1
is 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
best 0

a 0
bit 0
. 0
I 0
love 0
this 0
piece 0
of 0

will 0
be 0
hard 0
to 0

after 0
using 0

Apple 0
has 0
fixed 0
the 0
issue 0
. 0
It 0
's 0
ok 0
but 0
does 0
n't 0
have 0
a 0
disk 3
drive 2
which 0
I 0
did 0
n't 0
know 0
until 0
after 0
I 0
bought 0
it 0
. 0
There 0
is 0
no 0
HDMI 2
receptacle 3

nor 0
is 0
there 0
an 0
SD 3
card 2
slot 3
located 0
anywhere 0
on 0
the 0
device 3
. 0
It 0
really 0
is 0
very 0
light 0
compared 0
to 0
other 0
computers 0

It 0
came 0
in 0
brand 0
new 0
and 0
works 1
perfectly 0
. 0
This 0
machine 0
is 0
Amazing 0
. 0
It 0
should 0
n't 0
happen 0
like 0
that 0

I 0
do 0
n't 0
have 0
any 0
design 1
app 1
open 0
or 0
anything 0
. 0
MY 0
TRACKPAD 0
IS 0
NOT 0
WORKING 0
. 0
I 0
just 0
hope 0
this 0
expensive 0
laptop 0
does 0
n't 0
go 0
dead 0
like 0
my 0
friendsit 0
did 0
last 0
him 0
5 0
good 0
years 0
before 0
it 0
bit 0
the 0
dust. 0
. 0
Considering 0
another 0
computer 0
should 0
be 0
out 0
of 0
the 0
question 0
It 0
looks 0
and 0
feels 0
solid 0
, 0
with 0
a 0
flawless 0
finish 1
. 0
Its 0
worth 0
every 0
Penny 0
. 0
Price 0
was 0
higher 0
when 0
purchased 0
on 0

compared 0
to 0
price 3
showing 0
on 0
PC 0
when 0
I 0
bought 0
this 0
product 0
. 0
This 0
was 0
a 0
great 0
deal 0
for 0
a 0
decked 0
out 0
MacBook 0
Pro 0

Then 0
the 0
system 3
would 0
many 0
times 0
not 0
power 0
down 0
without 0
a 0
forced 0
poweroff 0
. 0
Get 0
this 0
instead 0
, 0
you 0
wo 0
n't 0
be 0
sorry 0
. 0
The 0
configuration 1
is 0
perfect 0
for 0
my 0
needs 0

and 0
the 0
speakers 1
is 0
the 0
worst 0
ever 0

I 0

suffering 0
from 0

just 0
for 0
what 0
I 0
needed 0
for 0

This 0
is 0
especially 0
disheartening 0
when 0
Apple 0
prides 0
itself 0
as 0
the 0
choice 0
of 0
creative 0
professionals 0
. 0
Apple 0
is 0
aware 0
of 0
this 0
issue 0
and 0
this 0
is 0
either 0
old 0
stock 0
or 0
a 0
defective 0
design 0
involving 0
the 0
intel 3
4000 0
graphics 1

Stop 0
living 0
in 0

stone 0

just 0

I 0
ca 0
n't 0
believe 0

keeps 0
making 0
the 0

mistake 0
with 0

So 0
glad 0
I 0
have 0
gone 0
this 0

It 0
wakes 0
in 0
less 0
than 0
a 0
second 0
when 0
I 0
open 0
the 0

It 0
is 0
the 0
perfect 0

THE 0
CUSTOMER 0
SERVICE 3
IS 0
TERRIFIC 0
! 0
! 0
Trashed 0
it 0
when 0
I 0
spilled 0
a 0
latte 0
on 0
it 0
while 0
writing 0
at 0
a 0
cafe 0
. 0
My 0
last 0
laptop 0
was 0
a 0
17 0
ASUS 1
gaming 0
machine 0
, 0
which 0
performed 0
admirably 0
, 0
but 0
having 0
since 0
built 0
my 0
own 0
desktop 0
and 0
really 0
settling 0
into 0
the 0
college 0
life 0
, 0
I 0
found 0
myself 0
wanting 0
something 0
smaller 0
and 0
less 0
cumbersome 0
, 0
not 0
to 0
mention 0
that 0
the 0
ASUS 0
had 0
been 0
slowly 0
developing 0
problems 0
ever 0
since 0
I 0
bought 0
it 0
about 0
4 0
years 0
ago 0
. 0
However 0
, 0
it 0
did 0
not 0
have 0
any 0
scratches 0
, 0
ZERO 0
battery 3
cycle 1
count 0
pretty 0
surprised 0
, 0
and 0
all 0
the 0
hardware 3
seemed 0
to 0
be 0
working 0
perfectly 0
. 0
After 0
fumbling 0
around 0
with 0
the 0
OS 1
I 0
started 0
searching 0
the 0
internet 0
for 0
a 0
fix 0
and 0
found 0
a 0
number 0
of 0
forums 0
on 0
fixing 0
the 0
issue 0
. 0
I 0
could 0
n't 0
be 0
more 0
pleased 0
. 0
I 0
needed 0
a 0
laptop 0
with 0
big 0
storage 0
, 0
a 0
nice 0
screen 1
and 0
fast 0
so 0
I 0
can 0
photoshop 0
without 0
any 0
problem 0
. 0
I 0
like 0
coming 0
back 0
to 0
Mac 1
OS 1
but 0
this 0
laptop 0
is 0
lacking 0
in 0
speaker 1
quality 1
compared 0
to 0
my 0
$ 0
400 0
old 0
HP 0
laptop 0
. 0
It 0
is 0
much 0
better 0
than 0
the 0
Acer 0
ultrabook 3

had 0
before 0
. 0
Shipped 0
very 0
quickly 0
and 0
safely 0

I 0
finally 0
own 0
a 0

that 0
I 0
do 0
n't 0
want 0
to 0
take 0
a 0
baseball 0

destroy 0
. 0
The 0

awesome 0
! 0
User 0

superior 0
to 0
any 0

I 0
've 0
ever 0
put 0
my 0

on 0
. 0
It 0
's 0
great 0
for 0
streaming 0
video 1
and 0
other 0
entertainment 0
uses 0
. 0
Apple 0
did 0
a 0
great 0
job 0
. 0
I 0
like 0
the 0
design 1
and 0
its 0
features 1
but 0
there 0
are 0
somethings 0
I 0
think 0
needs 0
to 0
be 0
improved 0
. 0
There 0
were 0
small 0
problems 0
with 0
Mac 0
office 0
. 0
It 0
is 0
extremely 0
fast 0
and 0
very 0
compact 0

should 0
call 0

about 0
any 0

is 0
my 0
purpose 0

still 0
works 1

purchasing 0
another 0

Performance 2

much 0
much 0
better 0
on 0
the 0

, 0
especially 0
if 0
you 0
install 0
an 0
SSD 1
on 0
it 0
. 0
Note 0
, 0
however 0
, 0
that 0
any 0
existing 0

not 0
work 0
with 0
the 0

If 0
you 0
get 0
a 0
lemon 0
I 0
have 0
two 0
thirds 0
of 0
my 0
Macs 0
, 0
you 0
have 0
to 0
send 0
it 0
in 0
for 0
repairs 0
several 0
times 0
before 0
they 0
will 0
replace 0
it 0
, 0
even 0
if 0

numerous 0
problems 0

Yeah 0
, 0
it 0

super 0
expensive 0
. 0
The 0
Mac 0

is 0
about 0
8x 0
smaller 0
than 0
my 0
old 0

which 0
is 0
a 0
huge 0
bonus 0
and 0
runs 1
very 0
quiet 0
, 0
actually 0
the 0

are 0
n't 0

were 0
not 0
The 0
product 0
they 0
Want 0

It 0
came 0
before 0
the 0
day 0
it 0
supposed 0
to 0
which 0
is 0
great 0
. 0
I 0
thought 0
the 0
transition 0
would 0
be 0
difficult 0
at 0
best 0
and 0
would 0
take 0
some 0
time 0
to 0
fully 0
familiarize 0
myself 0
with 0
the 0
new 0
Mac 0
ecosystem 0
. 0
It 0
's 0
absolutely 0
wonderful 0
and 0
worth 0
the 0
price 1
! 0
It 0
's 0
a 0
good 0
fix 0
, 0
in 0
my 0
opinion 0
. 0
I 0
am 0
please 0
with 0
the 0
products 0
ease 0
of 0
use 1
; 0
out 0
of 0
the 0
box 0
ready 0
; 0
appearance 1
and 0
functionality 1
. 0
Buying 0
a 0
Mac 0
Mini 0
would 0
allow 0
me 0
to 0
make 0
the 0
transition 0
. 0
its 0
by 0
far 0
faster 0
and 0
more 0
stable 0
then 0
my 0
PC 0
. 0
I 0
purchased 0
a 0
MacBook 0
Pro 0
and 0
this 0
to 0
replace 0
a 0
couple 0
of 0
HP 0
units 0
that 0
I 0
was 0
using 0
. 0
you 0
will 0
not 0
regret 0
it 0
, 0

you 0
! 0
Moving 0
from 0
a 0
PC 0
to 0
Mac 0
has 0
never 0
been 0
easier 0
, 0
and 0
I 0
'm 0
glad 0
that 0
I 0
did 0
it 0
. 0
Have 0
used 0
only 0
Macs 0
for 0
years 0
. 0
I 0
was 0
always 0
against 0
them 0

now 0
I 0
buying 0
one 0
I 0
'll 0
never 0
go 0
back 0
to 0

. 0
I 0
will 0
not 0
be 0
using 0
that 0
slot 3
again 0
. 0
I 0
think 0
that 0
was 0
a 0
great 0
decision 0
to 0
buy 0
The 0
OS 1
is 0
fast 0
and 0
fluid 0
, 0
everything 0
is 0
organized 0
and 0
it 0
's 0
just 0
beautiful 0
. 0
It 0
will 0
make 0
life 0
so 0
much 0
easier 0
next 0
semester 0
, 0
just 0
wish 0
I 0
had 0
it 0
last 0

paid 0
for 0
a 0

used 0
one 0
. 0
Searched 0
it 0
on 0
amazon 0
and 0
on 0
bestbuy 0
. 0
I 0
bought 0
this 0
one 0
for 0
my 0
11 0
year 0
old 0
and 0
the 0
MacBook 0
Air 0
for 0
my 0
9 0
year 0
old 0
. 0
I 0
bought 0
it 0
for 0
college 0
and 0
so 0
far 0
it 0
's 0
amazing 0
! 0
They 0
are 0
simpler 0
to 0
use 1
. 0
It 0
was 0
at 0
my 0
door 0
in 0
less 0
than 0
24 0
hours 0
. 0
It 0
was 0
getting 0
old 0
and 0
I 0
needed 0
a 0
new 0
school 0
computer 0
. 0
I 0
love 0
apple 0
but 0
unlike 0
others 0
That 0
does 0
not 0
prevent 0
me 0
to 0
not 0
be 0
honest 0
about 0
how 0
i 0
like 0
it 0
and 0
if 0
its 0
