This 0

to 0
be 0
the 0
best 0
japanese 0
restaurant 0
in 0
the 0
new 0

. 0
I 0
have 0
been 0
going 0
back 0
again 0
and 0
again 0
. 0
I 0
tend 0
to 0
judge 0
a 0
sushi 0
restaurant 0
by 0
its 0
sea 1
urchin 1
, 0
which 0
was 0
heavenly 0
at 0
sushi 0
rose 0
. 0
It 0
melted 0
in 0
my 0
little 0
mouth 0
and 0
the 0
perfect 0
consistencynot 0
too 0
fishy 0
, 0
creamy 0
, 0
and 0
slightly 0
buttery 0
. 0
The 0
sushi 1
seemed 0
pretty 0
fresh 0
and 0
was 0
adequately 0
proportioned 0
. 0
We 0
took 0
advanatage 0
of 0
the 0
half 1
price 1
sushi 1
deal 1
on 0
saturday 0
so 0
it 0
was 0
well 0
worth 0
it 0
. 0
I 0
went 0
to 0
this 0
restaurant 0
with 0
a 0
woman 0
that 0
I 0
met 0
recently 0
. 0
She 0
lives 0
nearby 0
but 0
had 0
never 0
gone 0
to 0
this 0
establishment 0
thinking 0
that 0
it 0
might 0
be 0
too 0
touristy 0
. 0
Surprisingly 0
nothing 0
could 0
be 0
further 0
from 0
the 0
truth 0
. 0
In 0
the 0
evening 0
, 0
this 0
place 0
attracted 0
a 0
well 0
dressed 0
, 0
with 0
it 0
, 0
NY 0
crowd 1
. 0
The 0
food 1
was 0
well 0
prepared 0
and 0
the 0
service 1
impecable 0
. 0
I 0
'm 0
going 0
back 0
. 0
Having 0
hunted 0
around 0
for 0
a 0
quiet 0
, 0
romantic 0
, 0
yet 0
not 0
hideously 0
expensive 0
restaurant 0
I 0
stumbled 0
across 0
reviews 0
for 0
La 0
Lanterna 0
and 0
gave 0
it 0
a 0
shot 0
. 0
Quite 0
simply 0
it 0
's 0
like 0
stepping 0
out 0
of 0
Manhattan 0
and 0
into 0
a 0
haven 0
of 0
tranquility 0
. 0
The 0
service 0
was 0
attentive 0
, 0
yet 0
unimposing 0
, 0
the 0
food 0
was 0
far 0
better 0
than 0
many 0
notorious 0
restaurants 0
in 0
Midtown 0
and 0
the 0
wine 0
list 0
is 0
extensive 0
and 0
well 0
priced 0
. 0
The 0
Prix 1
Fixe 1
menu 1
is 0
worth 0
every 0
penny 0
and 0
you 0
get 0
more 0
than 0
enough 0
both 0
in 0
quantity 0
AND 0
quality 0
. 0
I 0
will 0
be 0
going 0
back 0
and 0
heartily 0
recommend 0
it 0
! 0
It 0
is 0
terrific 0
, 0
as 0
is 0
the 0
value 0
. 0
$ 0
6 0
and 0
there 0
is 0
much 0
tasty 0
food 1
, 0
all 0
of 0
it 0
fresh 0
and 0
continually 0
refilled 0
. 0
I 0
am 0
not 0
a 0
vegetarian 0
but 0
, 0
almost 0
all 0
the 0
dishes 1
were 0
great 0
. 0
Frankly 0
, 0
when 0
you 0
compare 0
what 0
you 0
can 0
have 0
here 0
for 0
lunch 0
, 0
versus 0
McDs 0
or 0
so 0
many 0
other 0
sandwich 0
shops 0
in 0
the 0
city 0
, 0
there 0
is 0
no 0
comparison 0
. 0
Go 0
hungry 0
and 0
enjoy 0
. 0
The 0
food 1
here 0
is 0
rather 0
good 0
, 0
but 0
only 0
if 0
you 0
like 0
to 0
wait 0
for 0
it 0
. 0
I 0
like 0
the 0
somosas 1
, 0
chai 1
, 0
and 0
the 0
chole 1
, 0
but 0
the 0
dhosas 3
and 0
dhal 3
were 0
kinda 0
dissapointing 0
. 0
The 0
service 3
varys 0
from 0
day 0
to 0
day 0
sometimes 0
they 0
're 0
very 0
nice 0
, 0
and 0
sometimes 0
not 0
. 0
The 0
kitchen 3
however 0
, 0
is 0
almost 0
always 0
slow 0
. 0
Also 0
, 0
specify 0
if 0
you 0
like 0
your 0
food 3
spicy 0
its 0
rather 0
bland 0
if 0
you 0
do 0
n't 0
. 0
The 0
ambience 1
is 0
pretty 0
and 0
nice 0
for 0
conversation 0
, 0
so 0
a 0
casual 0
lunch 0
here 0
would 0
probably 0
be 0
best 0
. 0
Just 0
went 0
here 0
for 0
my 0
girlfriends 0
23rd 0
bday 0
. 0
If 0
you 0
've 0
ever 0
been 0
along 0
the 0
river 0
in 0
Weehawken 0
you 0
have 0
an 0
idea 0
of 0
the 0
top 0
of 0
view 1
the 0
chart 0
house 0
has 0
to 0
offer 0
. 0
Add 0
to 0
that 0
great 0
service 1
and 0
great 0
food 1
at 0
a 0
reasonable 0
price 0
and 0
you 0
have 0
yourself 0
the 0
beginning 0
of 0
a 0
great 0
evening 0
. 0
The 0
lava 1
cake 1
dessert 1
was 0
incredible 0
and 0
I 0
recommend 0
it 0
. 0
Once 0
you 0
step 0
into 0
Cosette 1
, 0
you 0
're 0
miraculously 0
in 0
a 0
small 0
, 0
offthebeaten 0
path 0
Parisian 0
bistro 0
. 0
This 0
tiny 0
restaurant 1
is 0
as 0
cozy 0
as 0
it 0
gets 0
, 0
with 0
that 0
certain 0
Parisian 0
flair 0
. 0
The 0
food 1
was 0
average 0
to 0
aboveaverage 0
; 0
the 0
French 3
Onion 3
soup 3
filling 0
yet 0
not 0
overly 0
impressive 0
, 0
and 0
the 0
desserts 3
not 0
brilliant 0
in 0
any 0
way 0
. 0
However 0
, 0
go 0
for 0
the 0
ambience 1
, 0
and 0
consider 0
the 0
food 2
just 0
a 0
companion 0
for 0
a 0
trip 0
across 0
the 0
world 0
! 0
I 0
have 0
never 0
eaten 0
in 0
the 0
restaurant 0
, 0
however 0
, 0
upon 0
reading 0
the 0
reviews 0
I 0
got 0
take 0
out 0
last 0
week 0
. 0
IT 0
WAS 0
HORRIBLE 0
. 0
The 0
pizza 3
was 0
delivered 0
cold 0
and 0
the 0
cheese 3
was 0
n't 0
even 0
fully 0
melted 0
! 0
I 0
have 0
eaten 0
at 0
many 0
pizza 0
places 0
around 0
NYC 0
and 0
this 0
is 0
hands 0
down 0
the 0
worst 0
. 0
This 0
has 0
got 0
to 0
be 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
most 0
overrated 0
restaurants 0
in 0
Brooklyn 0
. 0
The 0
pizza 3
is 0
overpriced 0
and 0
soggy 0
. 0
Yes 0
, 0
they 0
use 0
fancy 0
ingredients 1
, 0
but 0
even 0
fancy 0
ingredients 1
do 0
n't 0
make 0
for 0
good 0
pizza 3
unless 0
someone 0
knows 0
how 0
to 0
get 0
the 0
crust 3
right 0
. 0
A 0
big 0
disappointment 0
, 0
all 0
around 0
. 0
I 0
think 0
I 0
've 0
had 0
some 0
the 0
best 0
meals 1
of 0
my 0
life 0
at 0
minnow 0

there 0

list 1

and 0
the 0
everchanging 0
menu 1

some 0
great 0
surprises 0

The 0
combination 0
of 0
superfresh 0
ingredients 1
in 0
the 0
dishes 0
are 0
unusual 0

really 0
delicious 0

far 0
my 0
favorite 0

The 0
service 1
is 0
excellent 0

the 0
decor 1
is 0
great 0
, 0
and 0
the 0
food 1
is 0
delicious 0
and 0
comes 0
in 0
large 0
portions 1
. 0
You 0
'll 0
pay 0
at 0
least 0
double 0
at 0
any 0
other 0
Italian 0
restaurant 0
in 0
the 0
city 0
, 0
and 0
most 0
still 0
do 0
n't 0
compare 0
. 0
I 0
'm 0
partial 0
to 0
the 0
Gnocchi 1
. 0
This 0
place 3
is 0
incredibly 0
tiny 0
. 0
The 0
hostess 3
is 0
rude 0
to 0
the 0
point 0
of 0
being 0
offensive 0
. 0
The 0
food 3
was 0
bland 0
oily 0
. 0
I 0
just 0
do 0
n't 0
understand 0
all 0
the 0
hype 0
. 0
We 0
went 0
to 0
Ino 0
for 0
Valentines 0
. 0
We 0
have 0
been 0
to 0
this 0
place 0
many 0
times 0
, 0
and 0
always 0
have 0
great 0
food 1
, 0
wine 1
, 0
and 0
service 1
. 0
We 0
were 0
worried 0
we 0
would 0
have 0
trouble 0
getting 0
in 0
, 0
but 0
somehow 0
managed 0
to 0
have 0
a 0
short 0
wait 1
. 0
When 0
we 0
sat 0
, 0
we 0
got 0
great 0
and 0
fast 0
service 1
. 0
The 0
people 1
that 0
work 0
there 0
are 0
always 0
so 0
friendly 0
you 0
forget 0
you 0
are 0
in 0
New 0
York 0
sometimes 0
. 0
Make 0
sure 0
you 0
try 0
this 0
place 1
as 0
often 0
as 0
you 0
can 0
. 0
This 0
is 0
a 0
fun 0
restaurant 1
to 0
go 0
to 0
. 0
The 0
pizza 1
is 0
yummy 0
and 0
I 0
like 0
the 0
atmoshpere 1
. 0
But 0
the 0
pizza 3
is 0
way 0
to 0
expensive 0
. 0
A 0
large 0
is 0
$ 0
20 0
, 0
and 0
toppings 3
are 0
about 0
$ 0
3 0
each 0
. 0
I 0
went 0
there 0
for 0
lunch 3
and 0
it 0
was 0
not 0
as 0
good 0
as 0
I 0
expected 0
from 0
the 0
reviews 0
I 0
read 0
. 0
Sauce 3
was 0
watery 0
and 0
the 0
food 3
did 0
n't 0
have 0
much 0
flavor 0
. 0
If 0
you 0
like 0
the 0
food 0
and 0
the 0
value 0
you 0
get 0
from 0
some 0
of 0
Chinatown 0
restaurants 0
, 0
this 0
is 0
not 0
the 0
place 0
for 0
you 0
. 0
I 0
do 0
n't 0
think 0
I 0
would 0
go 0
again 0
. 0
I 0
had 0
a 0
huge 0
group 0
for 0
my 0
birthday 0

fantastic 0
service 1
. 0
There 0
was 0
a 0
small 0

shorter 0
than 0
I 0
expected 0

Located 0
at 0
the 0

of 0
a 0
magnificent 0
block 1
. 0
Very 0
cozy 0
and 0
warm 0
inside 0

I 0

The 0
one 0
on 0
the 0

much 0
better 0
than 0
the 0
one 0
on 0
the 0
west 0

. 0
Planet 1
Thailand 1
has 0
always 0
been 0
a 0
hit 0
with 0
me 0
, 0
I 0
go 0
there 0
usually 0
for 0
the 0
sushi 1

on 0
the 0

I 0
eat 0
here 0
often 0
and 0
never 0
get 0
bored 0
. 0
The 0
atmosphere 2
is 0
n't 0
the 0
greatest 0
, 0
but 0
I 0
suppose 0
that 0
's 0
how 0
they 0
keep 0
the 0
prices 0
down 0
. 0
It 0
's 0
all 0
about 0
the 0
food 1
! 0
! 0
I 0
went 0
there 0
with 0
my 0
friend 0
last 0
saturday 0
. 0
first 0
it 0
took 0
us 0
a 0
long 0
time 0
to 0
find 0
the 0
place 3
. 0
we 0
were 0
tired 0
and 0
cold 0
when 0
we 0
got 0
to 0
the 0
restaurant 0
, 0
then 0
we 0
sat 0
down 0
to 0
begin 0
ordering 0
appetizers 0
. 0
but 0
when 0
we 0
looked 0
at 0
the 0
menu 3
, 0
there 0
were 0
n't 0
a 0
lot 0
of 0
choices 0
, 0
most 0
of 0
them 0
were 0
dumplings 0
in 0
the 0
appetizer 0
section 0
. 0
then 0
we 0
ordered 0
a 0
dinosaur 0
rolls 0
and 0
white 0
tuna 0
sashimi 0
. 0
those 0
rolls 2
were 0
big 0
, 0
but 0
not 0
good 0
and 0
sashimi 3
was 0
n't 0
fresh 0
. 0
they 0
were 0
dry 0
and 0
disgusting 0
, 0
i 0
did 0
n't 0
even 0
finish 0
my 0
first 0
piece 0
. 0
Hurley 0
's 0
is 0
like 0
Cheers 0
where 0
everyone 0
knows 0
your 0
name 0
and 0
they 0
are 0
ACTUALLY 0
glad 0
you 0
came 0
. 0
Try 0
the 0
crunchy 1
tuna 1
, 0
it 0
is 0
to 0
die 0
for 0
. 0
Try 0
everything 0
for 0
that 0
matter 0
, 0
it 0
is 0
all 0
good 0
. 0
First 0
went 0
here 0
to 0
enjoy 0
their 0
garden 1
terrace 1
. 0
The 0
food 1
was 0
amazing 0
, 0
and 0
the 0
service 1
was 0
prompt 0
and 0
helpful 0
, 0
but 0
not 0
overbearing 0
or 0
rushed 0
. 0
The 0
Steak 1

is 0
a 0
great 0
bet 0
, 0
they 0
fix 0
it 0
for 0
you 0
at 0
the 0
table 0
. 0
Admittedly 0
some 0
nights 0
inside 0
the 0
restaurant 3
were 0
rather 0
warm 0
, 0
but 0
the 0
open 1
kitchen 1
is 0
part 0
of 0
the 0
charm 0
. 0
Great 0
wine 1
selection 1
, 0
Gigondas 1
is 0
worth 0
the 0
price 0
, 0
and 0
the 0
house 1
champagne 1
is 0
a 0
great 0
value 0
. 0
It 0
may 0
be 0
a 0
bit 0
packed 0
on 0
weekends 0
, 0
but 0
the 0
vibe 1
is 0
good 0
and 0
it 0
is 0
the 0
best 0
French 1

found 0
quite 0
the 0
gem 0
BUT 0
, 0
we 0
were 0
certainly 0
wrong 0
. 0
The 0
waitress 3
moved 0
our 0
table 0
practically 0
into 0
the 0
bathroom 0
and 0
when 0
we 0
asked 0
to 0
cancel 0
our 0
dinner 0

because 0
we 0
did 0
not 0
want 0
to 0
eat 0
sitting 0
on 0
the 0
toilet 0
, 0
we 0
were 0
told 0

she 0
dropped 0
used 0
silverware 0

my 0
boyfriend 0

jacket 0
and 0
did 0
not 0
stop 0
to 0
apologize 0
or 0
clean 0
the 0
mess 0
that 0
was 0
left 0
on 0
clothes 0

by 0
50 0

nice 0
to 0

some 0
mozzarella 0

Also 0
, 0

cold 0
very 0
quickly 0
and 0
its 0
not 0

upstate 0
for 0
a 0
while 0
I 0
would 0
buy 0

the 0
bagels 1
and 0
they 0
would 0
still 0
be 0
better 0
than 0
any 0
else 0
. 0
Worth 0
visiting 0
the 0
1st 1
Ave 1
spot 1
because 0
it 0
is 0
the 0
original 0
store 0
. 0

I 0
asked 0
the 0
chef 0

he 0
recommends 0
and 0
he 0
asked 0
me 0
if 0
I 0
like 0

which 0
happens 0
to 0
be 0
my 0

Aside 0
from 0
the 0

The 0

The 0
restaurant 2
is 0
cute 0
but 0
not 0
upscale 0
. 0
I 0
would 0
highly 0
recommend 0

bit 0
by 0
this 0
little 0
gem 0
. 0
The 0
bagel 1
was 0
huge 0
. 0
The 0
workers 0
there 0
also 0
absolutely 0
load 0
the 0
bagel 3
with 0
cream 0
cheese 0
gets 0
a 0
little 0
messy 0
. 0
I 0
loved 0
it 0
and 0
would 0
HIGHLY 0
RECOMMEND 0

This 0
was 0
my 0
frist 0
time 0
at 0

I 0
must 0
say 0
how 0
delicous 0
the 0
food 1
and 0
the 0
service 1
was 0
. 0
When 0
I 0
called 0
this 0
morning 0

I 0
did 0
n't 0
think 0
I 0
would 0
be 0
able 0
to 0
get 0
in 0
at 0
12 0
, 0
but 0
I 0

the 0
waiters 0
do 0
n't 0
have 0
enough 0
knowledge 0
of 0
their 0
dishes 0
. 0
But 0

do 0
. 0
If 0
you 0
want 0
to 0
dine 0
with 0
large 0

I 0
recommend 0
to 0
make 0

BASEMENT 0
. 0
There 0
's 0
nice 0

This 0
restaurant 3
was 0
way 0
overhyped 0
. 0
My 0

really 0
bland 0

oily 0
part 0
cause 0

it 0
was 0

too 0
bland 0

The 0
scallion 2

nothing 0
out 0
of 0
the 0

The 0
service 1
was 0
the 0
only 0
thing 0
good 0
about 0
this 0
restaurant 3
. 0
It 0
's 0
boring 0
on 0
the 0

and 0
our 0
sushi 3
was 0
pretty 0
below 0
average 0
the 0

was 0
soggy 0
and 0
the 0

had 0
no 0
flavor. 0

definitely 0
would 0

Unbelievable 0

day 0
it 0
was 0
fabulous 0
to 0

lunch 0
. 0
Ambience 1
is 0
so 0
cute 0
and 0
quaint 0
, 0
good 0
for 0
business 0
although 0
we 0
were 0
there 0
on 0

Although 0
we 0
were 0
looking 0
for 0
regular 0
lettuce 0
and 0
some 0
walnuts 0
the 0
salads 1
we 0
got 0
were 0
great 0
. 0
Ingredients 1
are 0
organic 0
which 0
is 0
a 0
real 0
plus 0
for 0
me 0

be 0
back 0

This 0
is 0
some 0
really 0
good 0
, 0
inexpensive 0
sushi 1

It 0
costs 0
$ 0
2 0
extra 0
to 0
turn 0
a 0
regular 0
roll 0
into 0
an 0
insideout 0
roll 0
, 0
but 0
the 0
roll 0
more 0
than 0
triples 0
in 0
size 0
, 0
and 0
that 0
's 0
not 0
just 0
from 0
the 0
rice 0
. 0
The 0
spicy 1
Tuna 1
roll 1
is 0
huge 0
and 0
probably 0
the 0
best 0
that 0
I 0
've 0
had 0
at 0
this 0
price 0
range 0
. 0
The 0
Yellowtail 1
was 0
particularly 0
good 0
as 0
well 0
. 0
In 0
any 0
event 0
, 0
this 0
is 0
a 0
place 1

'll 0
be 0
sure 0
to 0

absolutely 0
delicious 0

the 0
place 1
is 0
lovely 0

even 0
had 0
a 0
visit 0
from 0
the 0
Manager 1
who 0
wanted 0
to 0
make 0
sure 0
we 0
were 0
enjoying 0
ourselves 0
. 0
Yes 0
, 0
the 0
prices 0
are 0
high 0
, 0
but 0
I 0
felt 0
it 0
was 0
worth 0
it 0
. 0
We 0
all 0
felt 0
it 0
was 0
worth 0
it 0
. 0
sometimes 0

good 1

not 0
consistent 0

really 0
depends 0
on 0
your 0
luck 0

The 0
place 0
is 0
a 0
BISTRO 0

means 0
: 0
simple 0

served 0
efficiently 0
in 0
a 0

got 0
the 0
mushroom 1

tasted 0
better 0
. 0
The 0
sangria 1
was 0
pretty 0
tasty 0
and 0
good 0
on 0
a 0
hot 0
muggy 0
day 0
. 0
Kind 0
of 0
a 0
small 0
place 2
but 0
I 0
guess 0
if 0
they 0
are 0
not 0
too 0
busy 0
might 0
be 0
able 0
to 0
fit 0
a 0
group 0
or 0
kids 0
. 0
Overall 0
I 0
would 0
recommend 0
it 0
and 0
go 0
back 0
again 0

also 0
horrible 0

DO 0
not 0
try 0
unless 0
you 0
're 0
just 0
going 0
there 0
to 0
hang 0
out 0
like 0
the 0

of 0
the 0

apparently 0
have 0
no 0
sense 0

I 0
go 0
and 0
eat 0
out 0
at 0
many 0
different 0
restaurants 0

this 0

one 0
place 1

have 0
go 0

. 0
This 0
is 0
my 0
first 0
time 0
writing 0
a 0
review 0
for 0
a 0
restaurant 0
because 0
the 0
food 1
and 0
service 1
was 0
excellent 0
. 0
The 0
filet 1
mignon 1
dish 1
was 0
superb 0
! 0
I 0
would 0
defiantly 0
come 0
back 0
here 0
again 0
as 0
one 0
of 0
my 0
top 0
choices 0
. 0
It 0
's 0
a 0
small 0
cute 0
restaurant 1
. 0
From 0
the 0
street 0
it 0
looks 0
very 0
hidden 0
, 0
and 0
is 0
actually 0
an 0
old 0
warehouse 0
. 0
I 0
like 0
the 0
ambience 1
, 0
it 0
's 0
very 0
dark 0
and 0
original 0
. 0
I 0
came 0
here 0
for 0
my 0
friend 0
's 0
birthday 0
and 0
keep 0
coming 0
back 0
ever 0
since 0

amazingly 0
cheap 0
. 0
Big 0
thumbs 0

some 0
beef 3
and 3
noodle 3

dishes 3
from 0
the 0
Thai 0
section 0

the 0

were 0
very 0

Next 0

My 0

cover 0
the 0

although 0
it 0

it 0
was 0
not 0
nearly 0
enough 0
to 0
warrant 0
that 0
price 0
. 0
Went 0
to 0
Village 0
last 0
night 0
for 0
my 0
birthday 0
. 0
We 0
picked 0
it 0
randomly 0
, 0
without 0
a 0
recommendation 0
from 0
someone 0
who 0
has 0
been 0
there 0
, 0
so 0
we 0
were 0
n't 0
sure 0
what 0
to 0
expect 0
. 0
The 0
food 1
was 0
delicious 0
I 0
had 0
a 0
halibut 1
special 1
, 0
my 0
husband 0
had 0
steak 1
, 0
and 0
the 0
service 1
was 0
topnotch 0
. 0
Truly 0
the 0
mark 0
of 0
an 0
attentive 0
waiter 1
. 0
I 0
highly 0
recommend 0
the 0
restaurant 1
based 0
on 0
our 0
experience 0
last 0
night 0
. 0
We 0
ate 0
at 0
this 0
Thai 0
place 0
following 0
the 0
reviews 0
but 0
very 0
unhappy 0
with 0
the 0
foods 3

We 0
thought 0
that 0
this 0
place 0
is 0
using 0
too 0
much 0
of 0
MSG 0
cooking 0
in 0
the 0
foods 3
. 0
Why 0
? 0
They 0
do 0
n't 0
concern 0
much 0
of 0
customer 0
's 0
health 0
, 0
just 0
want 0
to 0
make 0
money 0

n't 0
fool 0
us 0

I 0
visit 0

Bo 0
when 0
I 0
have 0
money 0

when 0
I 0
am 0
broke 0

I 0
recommend 0
the 0
jelly 1
fish 1
, 0
drunken 1
chicken 1
and 0
the 0
soupy 1
dumplings 1
, 0
certainly 0
the 0
stir 1

The 0
service 3
was 0
terrible 0
, 0
we 0
had 0
to 0
wait 0
for 0
everything 0
and 0
ask 0
several 0
of 0
different 0
people 0
for 0
the 0
same 0
thing 0
before 0
we 0
were 0
allowed 0
to 0
be 0
served 0
. 0
The 0
waitress 3
, 0
seems 0
to 0
be 0
more 0
concerned 0
of 0
looking 0
good 0
than 0
actually 0
waitressing 3

The 0
whole 0
set 0
up 0

truly 0
unprofessional 0
and 0
I 0
wish 0
Cafe 1

would 0
get 0
some 0
good 0
staff 3
, 0
because 0
despite 0
the 0
current 0
one 0
this 0
is 0
a 0
great 0
place 0
. 0
Salads 1
are 0
a 0
delicious 0
way 0
to 0
begin 0
the 0

the 0

and 0
the 0

of 0
the 0

minutes 0
, 0
but 0
I 0
guess 0
that 0
's 0
the 0
price 0
you 0
pay 0
for 0
a 0
popular 0
place 0
. 0
I 0
would 0
definitely 0
recommend 0
SEA 0
if 0
you 0
like 0
thai 1
cuisine 1
! 0
I 0
was 0
here 0
a 0
few 0
weeks 0
back 0
and 0
we 0
had 0
the 0
worst 0
customer 3
service 3
experience 0
at 0
a 0
restaurant 0
ever 0
. 0
While 0
it 0
is 0
understandable 0
that 0
every 0
place 0
is 0
indeed 0
different 0
, 0
there 0
was 0
not 0
a 0
need 0
to 0
be 0
uncourteous 0
to 0
customers 0
and 0
downright 0
rude 0
. 0
The 0
service 0
was 0
poor 0
, 0
restaurant 0
poorly 0
lit 0
, 0
staff 0
not 0
very 0
attentive 0
and 0
I 0
would 0
have 0
rather 0
eaten 0
at 0
a 0
Mcdonald 0
's 0
than 0
this 0
joint 0
. 0
Never 0
again 0
! 0
I 0
absolutely 0
Loved 0
this 0
place 1
. 0
My 0
friends 0
spoke 0
so 0
much 0
about 0
it 0
for 0
months 0
, 0
I 0
finally 0
made 0
the 0
time 0
to 0
come 0
down 0
ear 0
and 0
dine 0
in 0
. 0
Excellent 0
atmosphere 1

think 0
that 0

If 0

The 0

has 0
been 0
nice 0
, 0
but 0
they 0
seemed 0
really 0
stressed 0
and 0
the 0
unisex 3

needs 0

be 0
cleaned 0
more 0

My 0

and 0
I 0
went 0
there 0
to 0
celebrate 0
my 0

the 0
other 0
night 0
and 0
all 0
I 0
can 0
say 0
is 0
that 0
it 0
was 0
magnificent 0
. 0
From 0
the 0
spectacular 0
caviar 1
to 0
the 0
hospitable 0
waitstaff 1
, 0
I 0
felt 0
like 0
royalty 0
and 0
enjoyed 0
every 0
second 0
of 0
it 0
. 0
Considering 0
we 0
were 0
the 0
last 0
patrons 0
there 0
and 0
it 0
was 0
after 0
the 0
closing 0
time 0
, 0
the 0
waitstaff 1
did 0
not 0
rush 0
us 0
at 0
all 0

made 0
us 0
feel 0

outstanding 0
, 0
particulary 0
the 0
salmon 1

I 0
had 0

good. 0
. 0
We 0
ate 0
out 0
in 0
the 0
back 1
patio 1
, 0
which 0
is 0
worth 0
it 0
as 0
it 0
's 0
cool 0
and 0
the 0
music 1
is 0
hear 0
well 0
there 0
. 0
Overall 0
, 0
excellent 0
restaurant 1
! 0
i 0
went 0
to 0
utsav 0
about 0
a 0
yr 0
ago 0
with 0
my 0
family 0
. 0
The 0
food 1
was 0
good 0
. 0
The 0
place 1
was 0
nice 0
and 0
calm 0
. 0
but 0
the 0
service 3
was 0
a 0
bit 0
slow 0
. 0
I 0
work 0
around 0
the 0
corner 0
and 0
tried 0
it 0
with 0
a 0
colleague 0
for 0
the 0
first 0
time 0
. 0
The 0
buffet 1
had 0
a 0
nice 0
selection 0
. 0
Service 1
was 0
also 0
very 0
good 0
. 0
I 0
would 0
go 0
back 0
. 0
I 0
got 0
an 0
excellent 0
piece 0
of 0
cheesecake 1
and 0
we 0
had 0
several 0
other 0
nice 0
pastries 1
. 0
My 0
son 0
and 0
his 0
girlfriend 0
both 0
wanted 0
cheeseburgers 2
and 0
they 0
were 0
huge 0
! 0
But 0
, 0
they 0
were 0
too 0
big 0
for 0
the 0
bun 0
. 0
Consequently 0
, 0
their 0
burgers 3
fell 0
apart 0
in 0
their 0
hands 0
and 0
made 0
such 0
a 0
mess 0
that 0
they 0
did'nt 0
feel 0
like 0
finishing 0
them 0
. 0
Also 0
they 0
were 0
$ 0
15 0
each 0
! 0
I 0
had 0
a 0
huge 0
pastrami 2
sandwich 2
on 2
a 2
roll 2
. 0
It 0
was 0
$ 0
14 0
not 0
really 0
bad 0
for 0
a 0
pound 0
of 0
Pastramibut 0
it 0
did 0
n't 0
have 0
much 0
tasteI 0
've 0
had 0
better 0
for 0
less 0
elsewhere 0
! 0
This 0
place 1
is 0
really 0
trendi 0
but 0
they 0
have 0
forgotten 0
about 0
the 0
most 0
important 0
part 0
of 0
a 0
restaurant 0
, 0
the 0
food 3
. 0
The 0
last 0
two 0
times 0
I 0
ordered 0
from 0
here 0
my 0
food 3
was 0
soo 0
spicy 0
that 0
I 0
could 0
barely 0
eat 0
it 0
, 0
and 0
the 0
spice 3
took 0
away 0
from 0
the 0
flavor 0
of 0
the 0
dish 0
. 0
If 0
you 0
want 0
good 0
authentic 0
Thai 3
this 0
place 0
is 0
not 0
the 0
place 0
to 0

. 0
We 0
went 0
here 0
for 0
lunch 0
a 0
couple 0
of 0
weeks 0

By 0
far 0
, 0
the 0
best 0

many 0
fish 0
items 0

oysters 0

We 0
all 0
ordered 0

up 0
on 0

I 0
stumbled 0
upon 0
this 0
great 0
pizzeria 1
as 0
I 0
explored 0
my 0
new 0
neighborhood 0
. 0
All 0
of 0
the 0
pizzas 1
are 0
terrific 0
and 0
the 0
price 0
is 0
even 0
better 0
! 0
I 0
highly 0
recommend 0
the 0
Sophia 1

. 0
It 0
's 0
to 0
die 0
for 0
! 0
The 0
food 3
was 0
mediocre 0
at 0
best 0
but 0
it 0
was 0
the 0
horrible 0
service 3
that 0
made 0
me 0
vow 0
never 0
to 0
go 0
back 0
. 0
Immediately 0
after 0
we 0
paid 0
, 0
the 0
waiter 3
took 0
the 0
money 0

. 0
As 0

were 0
leaving 0

the 0

to 0
another 0

're 0

that 0
was 0

This 0

only 0
a 0
few 0
months 0

is 0
perhaps 0
Queens' 0
biggest 0
secret 0

outside 0

the 0

spilled 0
red 0

on 0
myself 0

I 0
've 0

finally 0
got 0

Nevertheless 0
, 0
I 0
finished 0
my 0

that 0
's 0
when 0
I 0
found 0
a 0
maggot 0
in 0
mushroom 3

at 0
the 0
bottom 0

I 0
showed 0
it 0
to 0
the 0
manager 1

he 0
smilingly 0
apologized 0
and 0
brought 0
us 0
two 0
free 0
desserts 0
but 0
did 0
not 0
ask 0
us 0
what 0
we 0
wanted 0
and 0
so 0
brought 0
the 0
last 0
two 0
desserts 0
we 0
would 0
have 0
asked 0
for 0
. 0
When 0
the 0
bill 0
came 0
, 0
nothing 0
was 0
comped 0
, 0
so 0
I 0
told 0
the 0
manager 0
very 0
politely 0
that 0
we 0
were 0
willing 0
to 0
pay 0
for 0
the 0
wine 0

but 0
I 0
did 0
n't 0

I 0
should 0
have 0
to 0
pay 0
for 0
food 0
with 0
a 0
maggot 0
in 0
it 0
. 0
Yes 0
, 0
I 0
ate 0
the 0

I 0
certainly 0
would 0
not 0

if 0

seen 0
the 0

before 0

I 0
was 0
at 0
this 0
point 0
fairly 0
sick 0
to 0
my 0

We 0
paid 0

The 2
Four 2

history 0

it 0
is 0
a 0
sort 0
of 0
landmark 0
of 0
New 0
York 0
City 0
restaurants 0
, 0
but 0
trust 0
me 0
, 0
they 0
will 0
charge 0
you 0
through 0
the 0
nose 0
just 0
so 0
that 0
you 0
can 0
say 0
I 0
've 0
been 0
to 0
the 0
four 0
seasons 0
restaurant 0
. 0
I 0
wanted 0
to 0
go 0
there 0
to 0
see 0
if 0
it 0
was 0
worth 0
it 0
and 0
sadly 0
, 0
curiousity 0
got 0
the 0
best 0
of 0
me 0
and 0
I 0
paid 0
dearly 0
for 0
it 0
. 0
All 0
in 0
all 0
, 0
the 0
food 1
was 0
great 0
except 0
for 0
the 0
dessserts 3
. 0
The 0
environment 2
is 0
very 0
upscale 0
and 0
you 0
will 0
see 0
a 0
lot 0
of 0
rich 0
guys 0
with 0
trophy 0
wives 0
or 0
just 0
highly 0
paid 0
escorts 0
. 0
If 0
you 0
are 0
going 0
for 0
the 0
food 3
, 0
it 0
will 0
not 0
be 0
worth 0
it 0
. 0
Yes 0
, 0
it 0
is 0
good 0
, 0
but 0
I 0
've 0
had 0
better 0
for 0
cheaper 0
. 0
You 0
would 0
think 0
they 0
would 0
make 0
up 0
for 0
it 0
with 0
service 3
, 0
sadly 0
, 0
no 0
. 0
Service 3
was 0
just 0
ok 0
, 0
it 0
is 0
not 0
what 0
you 0
'd 0
expect 0
for 0
$ 0
500 0
. 0
I 0
agree 0
that 0
dining 0
at 0
Casa 3
La 3
Femme 3
is 0
like 0
no 0
other 0
dining 0
experience 0
! 0
BUT 0
not 0
in 0
a 0
good 0
way 0
. 0
I 0
literally 0
just 0
got 0
back 0
home 0
after 0
visiting 0
Casa 3
La 3
Femme 3
and 0
was 0
so 0
offended 0
by 0
my 0
visit 0
felt 0
it 0
necessary 0
to 0
try 0
and 0
warn 0
other 0
diners 0
who 0
value 0
their 0
money 0
and 0
time 0
. 0
We 0
went 0
to 0
celebrate 0
two 0
birthdays 0
and 0
wanted 0
to 0
do 0
something 0
special 0
and 0
different 0
. 0
And 0
even 0
more 0
so 0
unpleasant 0
because 0
it 0
was 0
so 0
costly 0
for 0
such 0
an 0
unpleasant 0
experience 0
. 0
We 0
did 0
arrive 0
late 0
for 0
our 0
reservation 0
so 0
I 0
can 0
not 0
complain 0
too 0
much 0
about 0
the 0
wait 2
for 0
a 0
table 0
. 0
Although 0
we 0
were 0
told 0
1015 0
minutes 0
and 0
it 0
was 0
more 0
like 0
45 0
minutes 0
. 0
We 0
were 0
ushered 0
to 0
the 0
bar 0
to 0
wait 0
momentarily 0
and 0
upon 0
arrival 0
were 0
so 0
excited 0
. 0
The 0
place 1
is 0
beautiful 0
! 0
The 0
hostess 1
was 0
very 0
pleasant 0
. 0
However 0
, 0
our 0
$ 0
14 0
drinks 3
were 0
were 0
horrible 0
! 0
Once 0
we 0
finally 0
got 0
a 0
table 0
, 0
despite 0
indicating 0
we 0
wanted 0
an 0
alla 0
carte 0
menu 0
we 0
were 0
pushed 0
into 0
a 0
table 0
that 0
was 0
only 0
price 0
fixed 0
! 0
Since 0
we 0
were 0
already 0
waiting 0
so 0
long 0
, 0
we 0
felt 0
we 0
had 0
no 0
other 0
choice 0
but 0
to 0
accept 0
it 0
. 0
Our 0
experience 0
did 0
not 0
ever 0
get 0
any 0
better 0
. 0
We 0
also 0
asked 0
for 0
Hooka 0
six 0
times 0
and 0
the 0
waiter 3
kept 0
telling 0
us 0
one 0
minute 0
and 0
never 0
returning 0
with 0
the 0
Hooka 0
. 0
After 0
the 0
4th 0
time 0
i 0
asked 0
again 0
and 0
the 0
waiter 3
than 0
said 0
after 0
our 0
dinner 0
. 0
We 0
asked 0
for 0
beverages 0
and 0
never 0
received 0
them 0
. 0
We 0
asked 0
for 0
sides 0
which 0
the 0
waiter 3
than 0
admitted 0
that 0
he 0
forgot 0
to 0
put 0
in 0
that 0
part 0
of 0
our 0
order 0
. 0
My 0
chicken 3
was 0
inedible 0
as 0
there 0
were 0
so 0
many 0
fatty 0
lumps 0
which 0
i 0
had 0
to 0
keep 0
spitting 0
out 0
into 0
my 0
napkin 0
. 0
I 0
would 0
not 0
expect 0
this 0
for 0
a 0
$ 0
55 0
dinner 3
. 0
By 0
the 0
time 0
we 0
finished 0
our 0
dinner 0
we 0
still 0
had 0
not 0
received 0
one 0
beverage 0
NOR 0
hooka 0
! 0
What 0
we 0
did 0
do 0
was 0
waste 0
3 0
hours 0
being 0
trapped 0
in 0
a 0
table 0
waiting 0
and 0
waiting 0
for 0
food 0
and 0
drinks 0
and 0
hooka. 0
. 0
some 0
of 0
which 0
we 0
never 0
received 0
! 0
The 0
only 0
beverage 0
we 0
did 0
receive 0
was 0
water 0
in 0
dirty 0
glasses 0
! 0
By 0
the 0
time 0
we 0
left 0
our 0
wallets 0
were 0
empy 0
and 0
so 0
were 0
our 0
stomachs 0
AND 0
we 0
missed 0
the 0
show 0
we 0
were 0
supposed 0
to 0
see 0
following 0
our 0
dinner 0
, 0
which 0
would 0
have 0
been 0
acceptable 0
if 0
we 0
got 0
to 0
enjoy 0
the 0
experience 0
of 0
good 0
food 3
and 0
belly 0
dancers 0
! 0
If 0
it 0
seemed 0
possible 0
to 0
do 0
so 0
while 0
there 0
I 0
would 0
have 0
fought 0
my 0
bill 0
since 0
my 0
dinner 0
portion 0
of 0
my 0
meal 3
was 0
inedible 0
! 0
I 0
have 0
never 0
left 0
a 0
restaurant 3
feeling 0
as 0
if 0
i 0
was 0
abused 0
, 0
and 0
wasted 0
my 0
hard 0
earned 0
money 0
. 0
I 0
wish 0
I 0
COULD 0
be 0
refunded 0
! 0
Do 0
n't 0
go 0
with 0
a 0
larger 0
group 0
than 0
4 0
! 0
I 0
went 0
here 0
for 0
a 0
family 0
birthday 0
dinner 0
. 0
The 0
hostess 0
said 0
Wow 0
that 0
's 0
a 0
large 0
group 0
, 0
unless 0
you 0
are 0
n't 0
together 0
, 0
to 0
which 0
I 0
replied 0
no 0
we 0
are 0
, 0
and 0
there 0
will 0
be 0
one 0
more 0
, 0
so 0
a 0
table 0
for 0
six 0
please 0
. 0
At 0
first 0
we 0
were 0
a 0
little 0
taken 0
aback 0
, 0
as 0
this 0
seemed 0
to 0
present 0
a 0
problem 0
, 0
although 0
the 0
restaurant 0
looked 0
fairly 0
empty 0
, 0
but 0
they 0
hastily 0
put 0
the 0
table 0
together 0
for 0
us 0
. 0
The 0
menu 2
is 0
fairly 0
simple 0
without 0
much 0
descriptions 0
. 0
There 0
was 0
no 0
tap 0
beer 3
that 0
evening 0
, 0
which 0
was 0
a 0
disappointment 0
. 0
Not 0
much 0
of 0
a 0
selection 3
of 3
bottled 3
beer 3
either 0
, 0
we 0
went 0
with 0
Brahma 0
. 0
The 0
lobster 2
knuckles 2
special 0
of 0
the 0
day 0
were 0
ok 0
, 0
but 0
pretty 0
tasteless 0
. 0
I 0
believe 0
there 0
were 0
2 0
shrimp 0
in 0
the 0
salt 3
encrusted 3
shrimp 3
appetizer 3
. 0
The 0
waitress 0
appeared 0
and 0
asked 0
us 0
if 0
we 0
wanted 0
to 0
go 0
ahead 0
and 0
order 0
. 0
We 0
replied 0
that 0
we 0
would 0
like 0
to 0
wait 0
5 0
more 0
minutes 0
if 0
that 0
was 0
okay 0
. 0
She 0
replied 0
well 0
it 0
would 0
be 0
more 0
convenient 0
for 0
us 0
if 0
you 0
ordered 0
now 0
, 0
since 0
you 0
are 0
a 0
larger 0
party 0
, 0
and 0
it 0
might 0
get 0
crowded 0
. 0
We 0
called 0
the 0
other 0
person 0
who 0
was 0
very 0
close 0
by 0
, 0
and 0
she 0
told 0
us 0
to 0
order 0
for 0
her 0
, 0
so 0
we 0
did 0
. 0
The 0
food 0
arrived 0
in 0
about 0
15 0
minutes 0
. 0
I 0
had 0
the 0
Thai 1
style 1
Fried 1
Sea 1
Basswhich 1
was 0
very 0
good 0
. 0
Everyone 0
seemed 0
generally 0
happy 0
with 0
their 0
food 1
, 0
except 0
my 0
brother 0
who 0
had 0
the 0
grilled 3
Mahi 3
Mahi 3
, 0
seemingly 0
drenched 0
in 0
Grapfruit 0
Juice 0
! 0
I 0
heard 0
the 0
lobster 1
roll 1
was 0
excellent 0
. 0
They 0
seemed 0
to 0
continue 0
to 0
rush 0
us 0
along 0
, 0
taking 0
plates 0
without 0
asking 0
if 0
we 0
were 0
done 0
my 0
sister 0
still 0
had 0
her 0
fork 0
in 0
hand 0

This 0

only 0
the 0
third 0
online 0
review 0
I 0
have 0
ever 0
made 0
about 0
a 0
restaurant 0
in 0
my 0
life 0
. 0
They 0
have 0
all 0
been 0
tonight 0
and 0
they 0
have 0
all 0
been 0
about 0
the 0
same 0
restaurant 0
. 0
I 0
have 0
never 0
been 0
so 0
disgusted 0
by 0
both 0
food 3
an 0
service 3
. 0
Fine 0
, 0
I 0
wont 0
hang 0
you 0
for 0
that 0
. 0
Not 0
one 0
to 0
jump 0
to 0
complaints 0
hence 0
my 0
lack 0
of 0
previous 0
online 0
reviewing 0
, 0
I 0
called 0
the 0
restaurant 0
to 0
give 0
them 0
a 0
heads 0
up 0
that 0
their 0
kitchen 0
might 0
want 0
to 0
check 0
the 0
cleanliness 0
of 0
their 0
prep 0
stations 0
. 0
My 0
main 0
concern 0
was 0
the 0
sanity 0
of 0
the 0
food 3
that 0
was 0
being 0
sent 0
out 0
to 0
myself 0
and 0
others 0
, 0
but 0
I 0
would 0
be 0
lying 0
is 0
I 0
said 0
that 0
as 0
someone 0
who 0
has 0
worked 0
in 0
restaurants 0
since 0
the 0
age 0
of 0
fifteen 0
I 0
was 0
expecting 0
at 0
least 0
a 0
minimal 0
effort 0
on 0
the 0
part 0
of 0
the 0
restaurant 0
to 0
amend 0
the 0
situation 0
. 0
None 0
was 0
made 0
so 0
i 0
hung 0
up 0
. 0
My 0
girlfriend 0
, 0
being 0
slightly 0
more 0
aggressive 0
, 0
and 0
having 0
been 0
equally 0
disgusted 0
causing 0
her 0
to 0
throw 0
out 0
the 0
remainder 0
of 0
her 0
barely 0
eaten 0
meal 3
, 0
called 0
back 0
only 0
to 0
be 0
informed 0
that 0
I 0
was 0
probably 0
wrong 0
and 0
that 0
it 0
was 0
most 0
likely 0
an 0
oyster 0
, 0
and 0
that 0
we 0
were 0
also 0
blacklisted 0
from 0
their 0
restaurant 0
. 0
Not 0
only 0
have 0
I 0
worked 0
in 0
restaurants 0
for 0
many 0
years 0
, 0
I 0
am 0
now 0
in 0
culinary 0
school 0
, 0
I 0
am 0
a 0
huge 0
lover 0
of 0
oysters 0
and 0
fish 0
, 0
and 0
my 0
girlfriend 0
is 0
half 0
Korean 0
! 0
We 0
know 0
the 0
difference 0
between 0
and 0
oyster 0
and 0
bad 0
fish 0
. 0
It 0
was 0
n't 0
as 0
if 0
this 0
restaurant 3
had 0
any 0
major 0
bragging 0
points 0
before 0
hand 0
, 0
but 0
now 0
it 0
's 0
simply 0
repulsive 0
. 0
Eat 0
at 0
your 0
own 0
risk 0
. 0
Gorgeous 0
place 1
ideal 0
for 0
a 0
romantic 0

I 0
took 0
my 0
boyfriend 0
for 0
a 0
dinner 0
on 0
saturday 0
night 0
. 0
I 0
completely 0
recommend 0
Casa 1

any 0
special 0
occasion 0

to 0
REALLY 0
impress 0
your 0

More 0
Williamsburg 0
Garbage 0
My 0
wife 0
and 0
I 0
visited 0
Dokebi 0
tonight 0
. 0
We 0
ordered 0
dosut 0
bibimbap 0
and 0
nakgibokum 0
. 0
The 0
bibimbap 2
was 0
average 0
, 0
but 0
the 0
stone 3
bowl 3
was 0
n't 0
even 0
close 0
to 0
sizzling 0
. 0
Too 0
bad 0
I 0
had 0
paid 0
an 0
extra 0
$ 0
2 0
for 0
the 0
stone 3
bowl 3
. 0
The 0
nakgibokum 3
was 0
horrible 0
. 0
Easily 0
the 0
worst 0
stirfried 3
squid 3
I 0
've 0
ever 0
tasted 0
. 0
The 0
sauce 3
tasted 0
more 0
like 0
Chinese 0
fast 0
food 0
than 0
decent 0
Korean 0
. 0
The 0
real 0
problem 0
I 0
had 0
with 0
this 0
place 0
was 0
the 0
complete 0
lack 0
of 0
service 3
. 0
I 0
mentioned 0
the 0
squid 0
dish 0
was 0
n't 0
very 0
good 0
when 0
the 0
waitress 0
visited 0
. 0
She 0
just 0
nodded 0
and 0
walked 0
off 0
. 0
There 0
were 0
no 0
communications 0
issues 0
either 0
, 0
as 0
she 0
spoke 0
perfect 0
English 0
. 0
As 0
to 0
my 0
comment 0
about 0
the 0
food 0
, 0
no 0
apology 0
or 0
acknowledgment 0
was 0
made 0
. 0
My 0
wife 0
had 0
barely 0
touched 0
that 0
mess 0
of 0
a 0
dish 3
. 0
We 0
were 0
charged 0
full 0
price 0
. 0
If 0
you 0
ware 0
looking 0
for 0
Korean 0
fusion 0
, 0
I 0
suggest 0
you 0
try 0
some 0
of 0
the 0
places 0
in 0
the 0
East 0
Village 0

Lives 0
up 0
to 0
the 0
hype 0
We 0
've 0
lived 0
around 0
the 0
corner 0
from 0
this 0
place 0
for 0
over 0
a 0
year 0
and 0
finally 0
had 0
dinner 0
there 0
. 0
We 0
've 0
tried 0
before 0
but 0
it 0
always 0
packed 0
and 0
does 0
n't 0
take 0
reservations 0
. 0
It 0
was 0
well 0
worth 0
the 0
wait 0
. 0
It 0
does 0
n't 0
look 0
appetizing 0
as 0
it 0
's 0
covered 0
in 0
squid 0
ink 0
and 0
it 0
turns 0
your 0
lips 0
and 0
teeth 0
black 0
, 0
but 0
the 0
taste 0
was 0
phenomenal 0
. 0
The 0
farro 1
salad 1
and 0
the 0
mashed 1
yukon 1

were 0
also 0
extremely 0

every 0
time 0

A 0
quintessential 0
slice 2
of 2
NYC 2
pizza 2
. 0
The 0
crust 1
has 0
a 0
great 0
bite 0
and 0
a 0
good 0
chew 0
, 0
the 0
sauce 1
is 0
light 0
with 0
a 0
nice 0
acidity 0
to 0
it 0
, 0
the 0
salt 0
from 0
the 0
cheese 1
is 0
great 0
, 0
really 0
heightens 0
the 0
flavor 0
of 0
all 0
the 0
other 0
components 0
. 0
Personally 0
I 0
like 0
the 0
margherita 1
pizza 1
better 0
, 0
but 0
they 0
are 0
all 0
good 0
. 0
Possibly 0
the 0
Most 0
Romantic 0
Restaurant 1
in 0
the 0
City 0
This 0
is 0
undoubtedly 0
my 0
favorite 0
modern 1
Japanese 1
brasserie 1
that 0
do 0
n't 0
serve 0
sushi 0
, 0
and 0
in 0
my 0
opinion 0
, 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
most 0
romantic 0
restaurants 0
in 0
the 0
city 0
! 0
Not 0
only 0
is 0
it 0
an 0
adventure 0
getting 0
to 0
this 0
somewhat 0
hidden 0
spot 2
, 0
once 0
you 0
enter 0
the 0
unmarked 1
wooden 1
doors 1
, 0
the 0
zen 0
and 0
intimate 0
decor 1
will 0
make 0
you 0
feel 0
like 0
you 0
're 0
no 0
longer 0
in 0
the 0
city 0
. 0
If 0
you 0
're 0
planning 0
to 0
come 0
here 0
, 0
make 0
sure 0
that 0
your 0
date 0
is 0
someone 0
whom 0
you 0
really 0
like 0
since 0
you 0
'll 0
be 0
ushered 0
to 0
private 1
booths 1
where 0
there 0
will 0
be 0
no 0
people 0
or 0
food 0
watching 0
choose 0
the 0
ones 0
on 0
the 0
ground 0
level 0
that 0
have 0
glass 1
ceilings 1
so 0
you 0
may 0
see 0
the 0
stars 0
in 0
the 0
sky 0
! 0
. 0
I 0
never 0
used 0
to 0
be 0
a 0
fan 0
of 0
sakes 0
but 0
am 0
lately 0
experimenting 0
with 0
it 0
a 0
lot 0
more 0
and 0
am 0
acquiring 0
a 0
better 0
taste 0
of 0
it 0
. 0
Our 0
first 0
course 0
was 0
Tuna 0
Sashimi 0
with 0
Green 0
Yuzu 0
Sauce 0
. 0
I 0
picked 0
the 0
Grilled 1
Black 1
Cod 1
as 0
my 0
entree 0
, 0
which 0
I 0
absolutely 0
devoured 0
while 0
someone 0
commented 0
that 0
the 0
Grilled 1
Salmon 1
dish 1
was 0
better 0
. 0
The 0
entrees 0
were 0
served 0
with 0
miso 0
soup 0
and 0
rice 0
. 0
For 0
desserts 0
, 0
we 0
tried 0
the 0
frozen 2
black 2
sesame 2
mousse 2
interesting 0
but 0
not 0
extraordinary 0
and 0
matcha 1
powdered 1
green 1
tea 1
and 1
blueberry 1
cheesecake 1
, 0
which 0
was 0
phenomenal 0
. 0
Maybe 0
it 0
was 0
the 0
great 0
company 0
I 0
had 0
friends 0
visiting 0
from 0
Philly 0
– 0
yes 0
, 0
it 0
was 0
not 0
a 0
date 0
this 0
time 0
or 0
the 0
super 0
reasonable 0
price 0
point 0
, 0
but 0
I 0
just 0
ca 0
n't 0
say 0
enough 0
good 0
things 0
about 0
this 0
brasserie 1
. 0
I 0
do 0
n't 0
usually 0
visit 0
the 0
same 0
establishment 0
more 0
than 0
once 0
, 0
what 0
more 0
twice 0
, 0
but 0
I 0
'll 0
come 0
to 0
Zenkichi 1
anytime 0
for 0
a 0
quiet 0
, 0
unhurried 0
and 0
memorable 0
dinner 0
. 0
Terrible 0
would 0
be 0
a 0
compliment 0
! 0
The 0
service 3
leaves 0
much 0
to 0
be 0
desired 0
, 0
from 0
feeling 0
like 0
you 0
are 0
rushed 0
the 0
place 0
your 0
order 0
, 0
to 0
being 0
ignored 0
the 0

They 0

This 0

any 0
sense 0
This 0
place 3

not 0
inviting 0
and 0
the 0
food 3
is 0
totally 0
weird 0

The 0
concept 0
of 0

Good 0
Food 1
I 0
went 0
here 0
with 0
my 0
boyfriend 0
for 0
our 0
anniversary 0
. 0
The 0
food 1
was 0
great 0
and 0
tasty 0
, 0
but 0
the 0
sitting 3
space 3
was 0
too 0
small 0
, 0
I 0
do 0
n't 0
like 0
being 0
cramp 0
in 0
a 0
corner 0
. 0
Over 0
all 0
it 0
was 0
a 0
very 0
nice 0
romantic 0
place 1

I 0
would 0
recommend 0
to 0
ask 0
for 0
a 0
bigger 0
sitting 0
area 0
when 0
you 0
make 0
a 0
reservation 0
if 0
possible 0
Loved 0
it 0
The 0
food 1
we 0
ordered 0
was 0
excellent 0
, 0
although 0
I 0
would 0
n't 0
say 0
the 0
margaritas 2
were 0
anything 0
to 0
write 0
home 0
about 0

Our 0
waitress 2
was 0
n't 0
mean 0
, 0
but 0
not 0
especially 0
warm 0
or 0
attentive 0
either 0
. 0
I 0
must 0
say 0
I 0
am 0
surprised 0
by 0
the 0
bad 0
reviews 0
of 0
the 0
restaurant 1
earlier 0
in 0
the 0
year 0
, 0
though 0
. 0
Maybe 0
it 0
has 0
improved 0
since 0
then 0
? 0
Regardless 0
, 0
we 0
'll 0
be 0
back 0
and 0
ca 0
n't 0
wait 0
to 0
visit 0
in 0
the 0
summer 0

take 0
advantage 0

the 0
patio 1

Dumbfoundingly 0
Poor 0
This 0
was 0

from 0

perfected 0
that 0

technique 0

took 0
one 0
look 0
at 0
the 0
chicken 3
and 0
I 0
was 0
appalled 0
. 0
It 0
was 0
served 0
with 0
skin 0
, 0
over 0
a 0
bed 0
of 0
extremely 0
undercooked 0
spinach 3
and 0
mashed 0
potatoes 0
. 0
My 0
boyfriend 0
asked 0
me 0
if 0
I 0
wanted 0
to 0
switch 0
and 0
eat 0
his 0
salmon 0
instead 0
, 0
while 0
he 0
deskinned 0
the 0
chicken 0
so 0
that 0
I 0
could 0
enjoy 0
the 0
white 0
meat 0
. 0
I 0
took 0
one 0
bite 0
from 0
the 0
$ 0
24 0
salmon 3
, 0
and 0
I 0
have 0
never 0
, 0
in 0
the 0
17 0
years 0
I 0
have 0
been 0
going 0
to 0
restaurants 0
tasted 0
salmon 3
as 0
fishy 0
, 0
as 0
dry 0
, 0
and 0
as 0
bland 0
as 0
the 0
one 0
in 0
Flatbush 0
Farms 0
. 0
At 0
this 0
point 0
, 0
the 0
waitress 3
comes 0
over 0
and 0
asks 0
us 0
if 0
everything 0
was 0
okay 0
, 0
I 0
was 0
literally 0
so 0
shocked 0
that 0
I 0
was 0
speechless 0
and 0
did 0
n't 0
say 0
anything 0
, 0
and 0
guess 0
what 0
, 0
the 0
waitress 3
WALKED 0
away 0
. 0
So 0
, 0
I 0
switch 0
with 0
my 0
boyfriend 0
again 0
to 0
see 0
if 0
maybe 0
I 0
could 0
stomach 0
the 0
meat 0
and 0
spinach 3
again 0
, 0
but 0
the 0
spinach 3
was 0
so 0
undercooked 0
that 0
I 0
just 0
could 0
not 0
bite 0
through 0
it 0
. 0
I 0
could 0
n't 0
even 0
enjoy 0
the 0
mashed 0
potatoes 0
because 0
it 0
was 0
hidden 0
completely 0
under 0
the 0
chicken 0
and 0
spinach 0
. 0
So 0
I 0
decide 0
to 0
report 0
back 0
to 0
the 0
waitress 0
because 0
it 0
was 0
completely 0
inedible 0
. 0
Guess 0
what 0
, 0
I 0
waited 0
for 0
TWENTY 0
minutes 0
before 0
she 0
came 0
over 0
and 0
when 0
she 0
finally 0
did 0
, 0
she 0
says 0
, 0
oh 0
well 0
, 0
I 0
wish 0
you 0
would 0
have 0
said 0
something 0
earlier 0
No 0
apology 0
, 0
nothing 0
. 0
I 0
was 0
literally 0
going 0
to 0
explode 0
, 0
but 0
instead 0
, 0
my 0
boyfriend 0
took 0
the 0
bill 0
and 0
went 0
to 0
find 0
the 0
manager 0
. 0
This 0
is 0
where 0
it 0
really 0
really 0
gets 0
bad 0
: 0
the 0
manager 3
said 0
, 0
there 0
is 0
absolutely 0
nothing 0
we 0
can 0
do 0
, 0
it 0
's 0
a 0
matter 0
of 0
taste 0
that 0
she 0
did 0
n't 0
like 0
it 0
, 0
and 0
I 0
can 0
not 0
comp 0
it 0
. 0
We 0
refused 0
to 0
pay 0
for 0
it 0
because 0
at 0
this 0
point 0
it 0
had 0
nothing 0
to 0
do 0
with 0
the 0
food 0
anymore 0
. 0
The 0
level 0
of 0
rudeness 0
was 0
preposterous 0
. 0
The 0
manager 3
came 0
to 0
the 0
table 0
and 0
said 0
we 0
can 0
do 0
what 0
we 0
want 0
, 0
so 0
we 0
paid 0
for 0
what 0

shortly 0
by 0
the 0

not 0

of 0
bad 0
behavior 0
by 0
a 0

totally 0
consistent 0
with 0
his 0

at 0

on 0
a 0
Saturday 0
dinner 0

When 0
the 0
main 0
course 0
finally 0
arrived 0
another 0
45mins 0
half 0
of 0
our 0
order 0
was 0
missing 0
. 0
Never 0
got 0
an 0
explanation 0
as 0
to 0
what 0
was 0
going 0
on 0
. 0
The 0
manager 3
was 0
rude 0
and 0
handled 0
the 0
situation 0
extremely 0
poorly 0
. 0
Ca 0
n't 0
believe 0
how 0
an 0
expensive 0
NYC 0
restaurant 3
can 0
be 0
so 0
disrespectful 0
to 0
its 0
clients 0
. 0
What 0
a 0
hassle 0
! 0
The 0
food 2
is 0
very 0
good 0
, 0
but 0
not 0
outstanding 0
. 0
There 0
is 0
no 0
way 0
it 0
justifies 0
the 0
accolades 0
it 0
receives 0
, 0
the 0
attitude 0
of 0
the 0
staff 3
or 0
the 0
wait 3
for 0
a 0
table 0

On 0
our 0
last 0
visit 0

they 0
skipped 0
over 0
our 0
name 0
on 0
the 0
list 0
, 0
leaving 0
us 0
waiting 0
an 0
extra 0
hour 0
for 0
a 0
table 0

Mistakes 0
happen 0
, 0
but 0
they 0
are 0
usually 0
accompanied 0
by 0
an 0
apology 0
, 0
perhaps 0
even 0
a 0
glass 0
of 0

not 0
the 0
grunt 0
that 0
we 0
received 0
from 0

. 0
Without 0
the 0
wait 0
or 0
attitude 0
, 0
I 0
would 0
probably 0
go 0
back 0
, 0
but 0
there 0
are 0
just 0
too 0
many 0
other 0
restaurants 0
in 0
Brooklyn 0
that 0
are 0
as 0
good 0
or 0
better 0
and 0
do 0
n't 0
make 0
me 0
jump 0
through 0
hoops 0

Expensive 0
I 0
went 0
there 0
after 0
hearing 0
how 0
great 0
it 0
was 0
. 0
Wow 0
. 0
The 0
bread 3
was 0
stale 0
, 0

salad 3
was 0
overpriced 0
and 0
empty 0
. 0
The 0
pasta 1
was 0
well 0
cooked 0
, 0
did 0
n't 0
have 0
enough 0
sauce 0
though 0
or 0
flavor 0
. 0
I 0
though 0
it 0
was 0
expensive 0
and 0
I 0
prefer 0
Bella 0
Via 0
just 0
blocks 0
away 0
by 0
far 0
. 0
I 0
went 0
with 0
JWILS 0
. 0
Her 0
review 0
is 0
above 0
. 0
I 0
was 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
people 0
that 0
went 0
for 0
this 0
horrible 0
experience 0
. 0
My 0
friend 0
is 0
100 0
% 0
right 0
in 0
the 0
experience 0
we 0
had 0
. 0
The 0
hostess 3
was 0
rude 0
and 0
I 0
got 0
a 0
distinct 0
feeling 0
that 0
they 0
did 0
not 0
want 0
to 0
serve 0
us 0
. 0
The 0
only 0
thing 0
that 0
my 0
friend 0
left 0
out 0
is 0
that 0
when 0
we 0
sat 0
down 0
at 0
the 0
bar 0
the 0
bartender 3
disappeared 0
. 0
I 0
asked 0
for 0
a 0
menu 0
and 0
the 0
same 0
waitress 3
looked 0
at 0
my 0
like 0
I 0
was 0
insane 0
. 0
I 0
was 0
shocked 0
that 0
my 0
friends 0
wanted 0
to 0
stay 0
after 0
the 0
waitress 3
said 0
, 0
can 0
I 0
help 0
you 0
and 0
how 0
many 0
are 0
in 0
your 0
party 0
. 0
What 0
? 0
The 0
three 0
of 0
us 0
standing 0
in 0
front 0
of 0
her 0
should 0
have 0
been 0
an 0
indication 0
of 0
how 0
many 0
of 0
us 0
there 0
were 0
. 0
We 0
did 0
n't 0
look 0
like 0
the 0
other 0
patrons 0
in 0
there 0
so 0
unfortunately 0
I 0
think 0
that 0
may 0
have 0
been 0
part 0
of 0
the 0
problem 0
. 0
Shame 0
on 0
this 0
place 0
for 0
the 0
horrible 0
rude 0
staff 3
and 0
nonexistent 0
customer 3
service 3

bad 0
staff 3
I 0
generally 0
like 0
this 0
place 1

The 0
food 1
is 0
good 0

But 0
the 0
service 3
is 0
HORRID 0

was 0
there 0
for 0
brunch 0
recently 0

and 0
we 0

delivered 0
our 0
food 0

a 0
plastic 0

I 0
ca 0

The 0

came 0
to 0

in 0
on 0
us 0
every 0
few 0
minutes 0
, 0
and 0
began 0
to 0
clear 0

eating 0
a 0
big 0
pet 0
peeve 0
of 0
mine 0
that 0
happens 0
almost 0
everywhere 0
, 0
so 0
I 0
try 0
to 0
ignore 0
it 0
. 0
She 0
then 0
put 0
the 0
check 0
down 0
without 0
asking 0
if 0
we 0
were 0
done 0
, 0
and 0
came 0
to 0
check 0
on 0
the 0
bill 0
every 0
two 0
minutes 0
, 0
even 0
though 0
we 0
were 0
one 0
of 0

I 0
wish 0
I 0
could 0
like 0
this 0
place 3
more 0
, 0
and 0
I 0
wish 0
someone 0
would 0
retrain 0
the 0
staff 3

They 0
never 0
brought 0
us 0
complimentary 0
noodles 0
, 0
ignored 0

requests 0
for 0
sugar 0
, 0
and 0
threw 0
our 0
dishes 0
on 0
the 0
table 0
. 0
After 0
all 0
that 0
, 0
they 0
complained 0
to 0
me 0
about 0
the 0
small 0

Avoid 0
this 0
place 3

at 0

The 0

For 0
the 0

, 0
you 0
can 0
not 0
eat 0
this 0
well 0
in 0
Manhattan 0
. 0
I 0
was 0
very 0
disappointed 0
with 0
this 0
restaurant 3

Ive 0
asked 0
a 0
cart 3

for 0
a 0
lotus 0
leaf 0
wrapped 0
rice 0
and 0
she 0
replied 0
back 0
rice 0
and 0
just 0
walked 0
away 0
. 0
I 0
had 0
to 0
ask 0
her 0
three 0
times 0
before 0
she 0
finally 0
came 0
back 0
with 0
the 0
dish 0

requested 0
. 0

up 0

so 0
glad 0

the 0
place 0

because 0
it 0
was 0
so 0
great 0
! 0
You 0
ca 0
n't 0
go 0
wrong 0
here 0
. 0
Every 0
time 0

I 0

it 0
a 0
point 0
to 0
visit 0
Restaurant 1
Saul 1
on 0
Smith 0
Street 0
. 0
Everything 0
is 0
always 0
cooked 0
to 0
perfection 0
, 0
the 0
service 1
is 0
excellent 0
, 0
the 0
decor 1
cool 0
and 0
understated 0
. 0
I 0
had 0
the 0
duck 1
breast 1
special 1
on 0
my 0
last 0
visit 0
and 0
it 0
was 0
incredible 0
. 0
Ca 0
n't 0
wait 0
wait 0
for 0
my 0
next 0
visit 0
. 0
I 0
had 0
my 0
eyes 0
on 0
this 0
place 0
, 0
promising 0
myself 0
I 0
will 0
one 0
day 0
give 0
it 0
a 0
try 0
. 0
' 0
And 0
I 0
hate 0
to 0
say 0
this 0
but 0
I 0
doubt 0
I 0
'll 0
ever 0
go 0
back 0
. 0
The 0
food 3
is 0
very 0
averagethe 0
Thai 3
fusion 3
stuff 3
is 0
a 0
bit 0
too 0
sweet 0
, 0
every 0
thing 0
they 0
serve 0
is 0
too 0
sweet 0
here. 0
. 0
The 0
only 0
thing 0
I 0
moderately 0
enjoyed 0
was 0
their 0
Grilled 1
Chicken 1
special 1
with 1
Edamame 1
Puree 1
. 0
I 0
had 0
never 0
had 0
Edamame 1
pureed 1
before 0
but 0
I 0
thought 0
it 0
was 0
innovative 0
and 0
tasty 0
could 0
've 0
used 0
a 0
bit 0
more 0
salt 0
. 0
Anyways 0
, 0
if 0
you 0
're 0
in 0
the 0
neighborhood 0
to 0
eat 0
good 0
food 0
, 0
I 0
would 0
n't 0
waste 0
my 0
time 0
trying 0
to 0
find 0
something 0
, 0
rather 0
go 0
across 0
the 0
street 0
to 0
Tamari 0
. 0
The 0
decor 1
is 0
night 0
thobut 0
they 0
REALLY 0
need 0
to 0
clean 0
that 0
vent 3
in 0
the 0
ceilingits 0
quite 0
unappetizing 0
, 0
and 0
kills 0
your 0
effort 0
to 0
make 0
this 0
place 3
look 0
sleek 0
and 0
modern. 0
. 0
We 0
ate 0
outside 0
at 0
Haru 0
's 0
Sake 0
bar 0
because 0
Haru 0
's 0
restaurant 0
next 0
door 0
was 0
overflowing 0
. 0
What 0
's 0
the 0
difference 0
between 0
the 0
two 0
? 0
Their 0
sake 1
list 1
was 0
extensive 0
, 0
but 0
we 0
were 0
looking 0
for 0
Purple 0
Haze 0
, 0
which 0
was 0
n't 0
listed 0
but 0
made 0
for 0
us 0
upon 0
request 0
! 0
The 0
spicy 1
tuna 1
roll 1
was 0
unusually 0
good 0
and 0
the 0
rock 1
shrimp 1
tempura 1
was 0
awesome 0
, 0
great 0
appetizer 0
to 0
share 0

Do 0
n't 0
judge 0
this 0
place 1
prima 0
facie 0
, 0
you 0
have 0
to 0
try 0
it 0
to 0
believe 0
it 0
, 0
a 0
home 0
away 0
from 0
home 0
for 0
the 0
literate 0
heart 0
. 0
i 0
have 0
eaten 0
here 0
a 0
handful 0
of 0
times 0
, 0
for 0
no 0
reason 0
besides 0
sheer 0
convenience 0
. 0
i 0
hang 0
out 0
, 0
and 0
live 0
, 0
in 0
the 0
neighborhood. 0
. 0
the 0
food 2
is 0
decent 0
. 0
however 0
, 0
it 0
's 0
the 0
service 3
that 0
leaves 0
a 0
bad 0
taste 0
in 0
my 0
mouth 0
. 0
i 0
happen 0
to 0
have 0
a 0
policy 0
that 0
goes 0
along 0
with 0
a 0
little 0
bit 0
of 0
selfrespect 0
, 0
which 0
includes 0
not 0
letting 0
a 0
waiter 3
intimidate 0
me 0
, 0
i.e. 0
make 0
me 0
feel 0
bad 0
asking 0
for 0
trivialities 0
like 0
water 0
, 0
or 0
the 0
check 0
. 0
i 0
know 0
, 0
you 0
were 0
too 0
busy 0
showing 0
off 0
your 0
vintage 0
tee 0
shirt 0
and 0
looking 0
bored 0
, 0
but 0
my 0
agenda 0
is 0
i 0
'm 0
here 0
to 0
eat 0
and 0
enjoy 0
the 0
company 0
of 0
friends 0
, 0
seeking 0
a 0
pleasant 0
experience 0
. 0
I 0
had 0
a 0
great 0
experience 0
. 0
Food 1
is 0
great 0
. 0
Service 1
is 0
top 0
notch 0
. 0
I 0
have 0
been 0
going 0
back 0
again 0
and 0
again 0
. 0
I 0
tend 0
to 0
judge 0
a 0
sushi 0
restaurant 0
by 0
its 0
sea 1
urchin 1
, 0
which 0
was 0
heavenly 0
at 0
sushi 0
rose 0
. 0
It 0
melted 0
in 0
my 0
little 0
mouth 0
and 0
the 0
perfect 0
consistencynot 0
too 0
fishy 0
, 0
creamy 0
, 0
and 0
slightly 0
buttery 0
. 0
The 0
sushi 1
seemed 0
pretty 0
fresh 0
and 0
was 0
adequately 0
proportioned 0
. 0
We 0
took 0
advanatage 0
of 0
the 0
half 1
price 1
sushi 1
deal 1
on 0
saturday 0
so 0
it 0
was 0
well 0
worth 0
it 0
. 0
I 0
went 0
to 0
this 0
restaurant 0
with 0
a 0
woman 0
that 0
I 0
met 0
recently 0
. 0
She 0
lives 0
nearby 0
but 0
had 0
never 0
gone 0
to 0
this 0
establishment 0
thinking 0
that 0
it 0
might 0
be 0
too 0
touristy 0
. 0
Surprisingly 0
nothing 0
could 0
be 0
further 0
from 0
the 0
truth 0
. 0
In 0
the 0
evening 0
, 0
this 0
place 0
attracted 0
a 0
well 0
dressed 0
, 0
with 0
it 0
, 0
NY 0
crowd 1
. 0
The 0
food 1
was 0
well 0
prepared 0
and 0
the 0
service 1
impecable 0
. 0
I 0
'm 0
going 0
back 0
. 0
Having 0
hunted 0
around 0
for 0
a 0
quiet 0
, 0
romantic 0
, 0
yet 0
not 0
hideously 0
expensive 0
restaurant 0
I 0
stumbled 0
across 0
reviews 0
for 0
La 0
Lanterna 0
and 0
gave 0
it 0
a 0
shot 0
. 0
Quite 0
simply 0
it 0
's 0
like 0
stepping 0
out 0
of 0
Manhattan 0
and 0
into 0
a 0
haven 0
of 0
tranquility 0
. 0
The 0
service 0
was 0
attentive 0
, 0
yet 0
unimposing 0
, 0
the 0
food 0
was 0
far 0
better 0
than 0
many 0
notorious 0
restaurants 0
in 0
Midtown 0
and 0
the 0
wine 0
list 0
is 0
extensive 0
and 0
well 0
priced 0
. 0
The 0
Prix 1
Fixe 1
menu 1
is 0
worth 0
every 0
penny 0
and 0
you 0
get 0
more 0
than 0
enough 0
both 0
in 0
quantity 0
AND 0
quality 0
. 0
I 0
will 0
be 0
going 0
back 0
and 0
heartily 0
recommend 0
it 0
! 0
I 0
've 0
had 0
the 0
lunch 0
buffet 0
at 0
Chennai 0
a 0
couple 0
of 0
times 0
, 0
when 0
I 0
have 0
been 0
in 0
the 0
neighborhood 0
. 0
It 0
is 0
terrific 0
, 0
as 0
is 0
the 0
value 0
. 0
$ 0
6 0
and 0
there 0
is 0
much 0
tasty 0
food 1
, 0
all 0
of 0
it 0
fresh 0
and 0
continually 0
refilled 0
. 0
I 0
am 0
not 0
a 0
vegetarian 0
but 0
, 0
almost 0
all 0
the 0
dishes 1
were 0
great 0
. 0
Frankly 0
, 0
when 0
you 0
compare 0
what 0
you 0
can 0
have 0
here 0
for 0
lunch 0
, 0
versus 0
McDs 0
or 0
so 0
many 0
other 0
sandwich 0
shops 0
in 0
the 0
city 0
, 0
there 0
is 0
no 0
comparison 0
. 0
Go 0
hungry 0
and 0
enjoy 0
. 0
The 0
food 1
here 0
is 0
rather 0
good 0
, 0
but 0
only 0
if 0
you 0
like 0
to 0
wait 0
for 0
it 0
. 0
I 0
like 0
the 0
somosas 1
, 0
chai 1
, 0
and 0
the 0
chole 1
, 0
but 0
the 0
dhosas 3
and 0
dhal 3
were 0
kinda 0
dissapointing 0
. 0
The 0
service 3
varys 0
from 0
day 0
to 0
day 0
sometimes 0
they 0
're 0
very 0
nice 0
, 0
and 0
sometimes 0
not 0
. 0
The 0
kitchen 3
however 0
, 0
is 0
almost 0
always 0
slow 0
. 0
Also 0
, 0
specify 0
if 0
you 0
like 0
your 0
food 3
spicy 0
its 0
rather 0
bland 0
if 0
you 0
do 0
n't 0
. 0
The 0
ambience 1
is 0
pretty 0
and 0
nice 0
for 0
conversation 0
, 0
so 0
a 0
casual 0
lunch 0
here 0
would 0
probably 0
be 0
best 0
. 0
Just 0
went 0
here 0
for 0
my 0
girlfriends 0
23rd 0
bday 0
. 0
Add 0
to 0
that 0
great 0
service 1
and 0
great 0
food 1
at 0
a 0
reasonable 0
price 0
and 0
you 0
have 0
yourself 0
the 0
beginning 0
of 0
a 0
great 0
evening 0
. 0
The 0
lava 1
cake 1
dessert 1
was 0
incredible 0
and 0
I 0
recommend 0
it 0
. 0
Once 0
you 0
step 0
into 0
Cosette 1
, 0
you 0
're 0
miraculously 0
in 0
a 0
small 0
, 0
offthebeaten 0
path 0
Parisian 0
bistro 0
. 0
The 0
food 1
was 0
average 0
to 0
aboveaverage 0
; 0
the 0
French 3
Onion 3
soup 3
filling 0
yet 0
not 0
overly 0
impressive 0
, 0
and 0
the 0
desserts 3
not 0
brilliant 0
in 0
any 0
way 0
. 0
However 0
, 0
go 0
for 0
the 0
ambience 1
, 0
and 0
consider 0
the 0
food 2
just 0
a 0
companion 0
for 0
a 0
trip 0
across 0
the 0
world 0
! 0
I 0
have 0
never 0
eaten 0
in 0
the 0
restaurant 0
, 0
however 0
, 0
upon 0
reading 0
the 0
reviews 0
I 0
got 0
take 0
out 0
last 0
week 0
. 0
IT 0
WAS 0
HORRIBLE 0
. 0
I 0
have 0
eaten 0
at 0
many 0
pizza 0
places 0
around 0
NYC 0
and 0
this 0
is 0
hands 0
down 0
the 0
worst 0
. 0
This 0
has 0
got 0
to 0
be 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
most 0
overrated 0
restaurants 0
in 0
Brooklyn 0
. 0
The 0
pizza 3
is 0
overpriced 0
and 0
soggy 0
. 0
Yes 0
, 0
they 0
use 0
fancy 0
ingredients 1
, 0
but 0
even 0
fancy 0
ingredients 1
do 0
n't 0
make 0
for 0
good 0
pizza 3
unless 0
someone 0
knows 0
how 0
to 0
get 0
the 0
crust 3
right 0
. 0
A 0
big 0
disappointment 0
, 0
all 0
around 0
. 0
I 0
think 0
I 0
've 0
had 0
some 0
the 0
best 0
meals 1
of 0
my 0
life 0
at 0
minnow 0
. 0
The 0
seafood 1
is 0
amazing 0
, 0
there 0
's 0
a 0
good 0
wine 1
list 1
, 0
and 0
the 0
everchanging 0
menu 1
always 0
offers 0
some 0
great 0
surprises 0
. 0
The 0
combination 0
of 0
superfresh 0
ingredients 1
in 0
the 0
dishes 0
are 0
unusual 0
but 0
really 0
delicious 0
. 0
Worth 0
the 0
trip 0
from 0
Manhattan 0
. 0
Was 0
there 0
Friday 0
night 0
. 0
Best 0
Pastrami 1
I 0
ever 0
had 0
and 0
great 0
portion 1
without 0
being 0
ridiculous 0
. 0
And 0
I 0
've 0
been 0
to 0
many 0
NYC 0
delis 0
. 0
My 0
wife 0
had 0
the 0
fried 1
shrimp 1
which 0
are 0
huge 0
and 0
loved 0
it 0
. 0
Price 0
no 0
more 0
than 0
a 0
Jersey 0
deli 0
but 0
way 0
better 0
. 0
As 0
a 0
Japanese 0
native 0
, 0
I 0
've 0
lived 0
in 0
the 0
Tristate 0
area 0
for 0
over 0
8 0
years 0
, 0
but 0
I 0
was 0
just 0
so 0
amazed 0
at 0
this 0
place 1

This 0
place 1
is 0
the 0

somehow 0
managed 0
to 0
have 0
a 0

Sauce 3

flavor 0
. 0
If 0
you 0
like 0
the 0
food 0
and 0
the 0
value 0
you 0
get 0
from 0
some 0
of 0
Chinatown 0
restaurants 0
, 0
this 0
is 0
not 0
the 0
place 0
for 0
you 0

I 0
do 0
n't 0
think 0
I 0
would 0
go 0
again 0

This 0
place 1

great 0
. 0
I 0
had 0

Slightly 0
on 0
the 0
pricey 0
side 0

worth 0
it 0
! 0
Great 0
pizza 1
and 0
fantastic 0
service 1
. 0
There 0
was 0
a 0
small 0
wait 1

Located 0
at 0
the 0

The 0
one 0

Planet 1
Thailand 1
has 0
always 0
been 0
a 0
hit 0
with 0
me 0

go 0
there 0
usually 0
for 0
the 0

bored 0
. 0
The 0
atmosphere 3
is 0
n't 0
the 0
greatest 0
, 0
but 0
I 0
suppose 0
that 0
's 0
how 0
they 0
keep 0
the 0
prices 0
down 0
. 0
It 0
's 0
all 0
about 0
the 0
food 1
! 0
! 0
I 0
went 0
there 0
with 0
my 0
friend 0
last 0
saturday 0
. 0
first 0
it 0
took 0
us 0
a 0
long 0
time 0
to 0
find 0
the 0
place 3
. 0
we 0
were 0
tired 0
and 0
cold 0
when 0
we 0
got 0
to 0
the 0
restaurant 0
, 0
then 0
we 0
sat 0
down 0
to 0
begin 0
ordering 0
appetizers 0
. 0
but 0
when 0
we 0
looked 0
at 0
the 0
menu 3
, 0
there 0
were 0
n't 0
a 0
lot 0
of 0
choices 0
, 0
most 0
of 0
them 0
were 0
dumplings 0
in 0
the 0
appetizer 0
section 0
. 0
then 0
we 0
ordered 0
a 0
dinosaur 0
rolls 0
and 0
white 0
tuna 0
sashimi 0
. 0
those 0
rolls 2
were 0
big 0
, 0
but 0
not 0
good 0
and 0
sashimi 3
was 0
n't 0
fresh 0
. 0
they 0
were 0
dry 0
and 0
disgusting 0
, 0
i 0
did 0
n't 0
even 0
finish 0
my 0
first 0
piece 0
. 0
Hurley 0
's 0
is 0
like 0
Cheers 0
where 0
everyone 0
knows 0
your 0
name 0
and 0
they 0
are 0
ACTUALLY 0
glad 0
you 0
came 0
. 0
Try 0
the 0
crunchy 1
tuna 1
, 0
it 0
is 0
to 0
die 0
for 0
. 0
I 0
have 0
been 0
going 0
there 0
since 0
it 0
opened 0
and 0
I 0
ca 0
n't 0
get 0
enough 0
. 0
First 0
went 0
here 0
to 0
enjoy 0
their 0
garden 1
terrace 1
. 0
The 0
food 1
was 0
amazing 0
, 0
and 0
the 0
service 1
was 0
prompt 0
and 0
helpful 0
, 0
but 0
not 0
overbearing 0
or 0
rushed 0
. 0
The 0
Steak 1

a 0
great 0
bet 0
, 0
they 0
fix 0
it 0
for 0
you 0
at 0
the 0
table 0
. 0
Admittedly 0
some 0
nights 0
inside 0
the 0
restaurant 3
were 0
rather 0
warm 0
, 0
but 0
the 0
open 1
kitchen 1
is 0
part 0
of 0
the 0
charm 0
. 0
Great 0
wine 1
selection 1
, 0
Gigondas 1
is 0
worth 0
the 0
price 0
, 0
and 0
the 0
house 1
champagne 1
is 0
a 0
great 0
value 0
. 0
It 0
may 0
be 0
a 0
bit 0
packed 0
on 0
weekends 0
, 0
but 0
the 0
vibe 1
is 0
good 0
and 0
it 0
is 0
the 0
best 0
French 1

Tiny 0

thought 0
that 0
we 0
had 0
found 0
quite 0
the 0
gem 0
BUT 0
, 0
we 0
were 0
certainly 0
wrong 0
. 0
The 0
waitress 3
moved 0
our 0
table 0
practically 0
into 0
the 0
bathroom 0
and 0
when 0
we 0
asked 0
to 0
cancel 0
our 0
dinner 0
orders 0
because 0
we 0
did 0
not 0
want 0
to 0
eat 0
sitting 0
on 0
the 0
toilet 0
, 0
we 0
were 0
told 0
no 0

nice 0
to 0
get 0
some 0
mozzarella 0

Also 0
, 0
because 0

thin 0
, 0
it 0
gets 0
cold 0
very 0
quickly 0
and 0
its 0
not 0

So 0

Fridays 0

Being 0

we 0
sat 0
at 0
the 0

to 0
be 0
closer 0
to 0
the 0
action 0
. 0
I 0
asked 0
the 0
chef 0
what 0
he 0
recommends 0
and 0
he 0
asked 0
me 0
if 0
I 0
like 0
Uni 0

For 0
those 0
of 0
you 0
who 0
do 0

! 0
All 0
in 0

. 0
I 0

the 0
food 1
was 0
delicious 0
, 0
if 0
I 0

The 0
entertainment 1
was 0
great 0

shows 0

disapointed 0
at 0

had 0
to 0
try 0
a 0
New 0
York 0
Bagel 0
. 0
We 0
were 0
not 0
dissappointed 0
in 0
the 0
least 0
bit 0
by 0
this 0
little 0
gem 0
. 0
The 0
bagel 1
was 0
huge 0
. 0
They 0
were 0
served 0
warm 0
and 0
had 0
a 0
soft 0
fluffy 0
interior 0
. 0
The 0
workers 0
there 0
also 0
absolutely 0
load 0
the 0
bagel 3
with 0
cream 0
cheese 0
gets 0
a 0
little 0
messy 0
. 0
This 0
was 0
my 0
frist 0
time 0
at 0
Cafe 0
St. 0
Bart 0
's 0
and 0
I 0
must 0
say 0
how 0
delicous 0
the 0
food 1
and 0
the 0
service 1
was 0
. 0
When 0
I 0
called 0
this 0
morning 0
, 0
I 0
did 0
n't 0
think 0
I 0
would 0
be 0
able 0
to 0
get 0
in 0
at 0
12 0
, 0
but 0
I 0
was 0
able 0

. 0
I 0
highly 0

All 0

I 0
sometimes 0
see 0
the 0
waiters 0
do 0
n't 0
have 0
enough 0
knowledge 0
of 0
their 0
dishes 0
. 0
But 0

do 0
. 0
If 0
you 0
want 0
to 0
dine 0
with 0
large 0

I 0
recommend 0
to 0
make 0
reservation 0
BASEMENT 0
. 0
There 0
's 0
nice 0

This 0
restaurant 3
was 0
way 0
overhyped 0
. 0
My 0
chow 3

really 0
bland 0

mind 0
the 0
oily 0
part 0
cause 0
most 0

cooked 0
that 0
way 0

it 0
was 0
way 0
too 0
bland 0

The 0
scallion 2

nothing 0
out 0
of 0
the 0
ordinary 0
. 0
The 0
service 1
was 0
the 0
only 0
thing 0
good 0
about 0
this 0
restaurant 3
. 0
It 0
's 0
boring 0
on 0
the 0
inside 0
, 0
and 0
our 0
sushi 3
was 0
pretty 0
below 0
average 0
the 0
tuna 3
was 0
soggy 0
and 0
the 0
other 0
rolls 3
had 0
no 0
flavor. 0

I 0
definitely 0
would 0
n't 0
go 0
back 0

and 0
very 0
spicy 0

. 0
Ambience 1
is 0
so 0
cute 0
and 0
quaint 0
, 0
good 0
for 0
business 0
although 0
we 0
were 0
there 0
on 0

Although 0
we 0
were 0
looking 0
for 0
regular 0
lettuce 0

got 0
were 0
great 0

is 0
a 0
real 0
plus 0
for 0

This 0
is 0
some 0
really 0
good 0

inexpensive 0
sushi 1

2 0
extra 0
to 0
turn 0
a 0
regular 0
roll 0
into 0
an 0
insideout 0
roll 0
, 0
but 0
the 0
roll 0
more 0
than 0
triples 0
in 0
size 0
, 0
and 0
that 0
's 0
not 0
just 0
from 0
the 0
rice 0
. 0
The 0
spicy 1
Tuna 1
roll 1
is 0
huge 0
and 0
probably 0
the 0
best 0
that 0
I 0
've 0
had 0
at 0
this 0
price 0
range 0
. 0
The 0
Yellowtail 1
was 0
particularly 0
good 0
as 0
well 0

In 0

this 0
is 0
a 0
place 1

literally 0
walking 0
around 0
doing 0
things 0
as 0

as 0
they 0
can 0
. 0
The 0

were 0
served 0
timely 0

food 1
was 0
absolutely 0
delicious 0

the 0
place 1
is 0
lovely 0
. 0
We 0
even 0
had 0
a 0
visit 0
from 0
the 0
Manager 1

wanted 0
to 0
make 0
sure 0
we 0
were 0
enjoying 0
ourselves 0
. 0
Yes 0
, 0
the 0
prices 0
are 0
high 0
, 0
but 0
I 0
felt 0
it 0
was 0
worth 0
it 0
. 0
We 0
all 0
felt 0
it 0
was 0
worth 0
it 0
. 0
sometimes 0
i 0
get 0
good 0
food 1
and 0
ok 0
service 2
. 0
it 0
is 0
not 0
consistent 0
. 0
really 0
depends 0
on 0
your 0
luck 0
! 0
The 0
place 0
is 0
a 0
BISTRO 0
which 0
means 0
: 0
simple 0
dishes 1
and 0
wine 1
served 0
efficiently 0
in 0
a 0
bustling 0
atmosphere 1

And 0
where 0

You 0
are 0
not 0
eating 0

kind 0
of 0
bitter 0
though 0

My 0
friend 0
got 0
the 0
mushroom 1

which 0
tasted 0
better 0
. 0
The 0
sangria 1
was 0
pretty 0
tasty 0
and 0
good 0
on 0
a 0
hot 0
muggy 0
day 0
. 0
Kind 0
of 0
a 0
small 0
place 2
but 0
I 0
guess 0
if 0
they 0
are 0
not 0
too 0
busy 0
might 0
be 0
able 0
to 0
fit 0
a 0
group 0
or 0
kids 0
. 0
Overall 0
I 0
would 0
recommend 0
it 0
and 0
go 0
back 0
again 0

started 0
out 0
with 0

was 0
like 0
rubber 0
and 0
the 0
tuna 3
was 0
flavorless 0
not 0
to 0
mention 0
it 0
tasted 0
like 0
it 0
had 0
just 0
been 0
thawed 0
. 0
Service 3
was 0
also 0
horrible 0
and 0
the 0
ambience 3
is 0
not 0
that 0
great 0
. 0
DO 0
not 0
try 0
unless 0
you 0
're 0
just 0
going 0
there 0
to 0
hang 0
out 0
like 0
the 0
rest 0
of 0
the 0
hipsters 0
who 0
apparently 0
have 0
no 0
sense 0
of 0
taste 0

I 0
go 0
and 0
eat 0
out 0
at 0
many 0
different 0
restaurants 0
and 0
this 0
is 0
one 0
place 1
you 0
have 0
go 0

try 0
. 0
This 0
is 0
my 0
first 0
time 0
writing 0
a 0
review 0
for 0
a 0
restaurant 0
because 0
the 0
food 1
and 0
service 1
was 0
excellent 0
. 0
The 0
filet 1
mignon 1
dish 1
was 0
superb 0
! 0
I 0
would 0
defiantly 0
come 0
back 0
here 0
again 0
as 0
one 0
of 0
my 0
top 0
choices 0
. 0
It 0
's 0
a 0
small 0
cute 0
restaurant 1
. 0
From 0
the 0
street 0
it 0
looks 0
very 0
hidden 0
, 0
and 0
is 0
actually 0
an 0
old 0
warehouse 0
. 0
I 0
like 0
the 0
ambience 1
, 0
it 0
's 0
very 0
dark 0
and 0
original 0
. 0
I 0
came 0
here 0
for 0
my 0
friend 0
's 0
birthday 0
and 0
keep 0
coming 0
back 0
ever 0
since 0
. 0
And 0
amazingly 0
cheap 0
. 0
Big 0
thumbs 0
up 0
! 0
Very 0
affordable 0
and 0
excellent 0
ambient 1

from 0
the 0

nothing 0

got 0
was 0
Thai 0

We 0
were 0
very 0
disappointed 0
. 0
We 0
wo 0
n't 0
go 0
to 0
this 0
place 0
again 0
for 0
a 0
good 0
meal 3

However 0
, 0
I 0
think 0
this 0
place 1
is 0
a 0
good 0
hang 0
out 0
spot 0
. 0
Next 0
time 0
, 0
we 0
would 0
n't 0
dare 0
ordering 0
anything 0
else 0
other 0
than 0
some 0
simple 0
Asian 0
appetizers 0
and 0

My 0
Girlfriend 0

I 0
stumbled 0
onto 0

This 0

pricey 0

Went 0
to 0

last 0
night 0
for 0
my 0
birthday 0

We 0
picked 0
it 0
randomly 0
, 0
without 0
a 0
recommendation 0
from 0
someone 0
who 0
has 0
been 0
there 0
, 0
so 0
we 0
were 0
n't 0
sure 0
what 0
to 0
expect 0
. 0
We 0
were 0
very 0
pleasantly 0
surprised 0
. 0
Truly 0
the 0
mark 0
of 0
an 0
attentive 0
waiter 1
. 0
We 0
ate 0
at 0
this 0
Thai 0
place 0
following 0
the 0
reviews 0
but 0
very 0
unhappy 0
with 0
the 0
foods 3
. 0
We 0
thought 0
that 0
this 0
place 0
is 0
using 0
too 0
much 0
of 0
MSG 0
cooking 0
in 0
the 0
foods 3
. 0
Why 0
? 0
They 0
do 0
n't 0
concern 0
much 0
of 0

health 0
, 0
just 0
want 0
to 0

have 0
money 0

recommend 0
the 0
jelly 1

drunken 1
chicken 1

the 0
soupy 1
dumplings 1

certainly 0
the 0

The 0
service 3
was 0
terrible 0

everything 0

ask 0
several 0

people 0
for 0
the 0

before 0
we 0
were 0
allowed 0

The 0
waitress 3

seems 0
to 0
be 0
more 0
concerned 0

looking 0
good 0
than 0
actually 0
waitressing 3

unprofessional 0
and 0
I 0
wish 0
Cafe 1

would 0
get 0
some 0
good 0

great 0
, 0
on 0
top 0
of 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
the 0
food 1
was 0
really 0
tasty 0
. 0
I 0
was 0
n't 0
thrilled 0
to 0
have 0
to 0
wait 0
on 0
line 0
for 0
thirty 0
minutes 0
, 0
but 0
I 0
guess 0
that 0
's 0
the 0
price 0
you 0
pay 0
for 0
a 0
popular 0
place 0
. 0
I 0
would 0
definitely 0
recommend 0
SEA 0
if 0
you 0
like 0
thai 1
cuisine 1
! 0
I 0
was 0
here 0
a 0
few 0
weeks 0
back 0
and 0
we 0
had 0
the 0
worst 0
customer 3
service 3
experience 0
at 0
a 0
restaurant 0
ever 0
. 0
A 0
gentleman 3
, 0
maybe 0
the 0
manager 0
, 0
came 0
to 0
our 0
table 0
, 0
and 0
without 0
so 0
much 0
as 0
a 0
smile 0
or 0
greeting 0
asked 0
for 0
our 0
order 0
. 0
When 0
asked 0
about 0
how 0
a 0
certain 0
dish 0
was 0
prepared 0
in 0
comparison 0
to 0
a 0
similar 0
at 0
other 0
thai 0
restaurants 0
, 0
he 0
replied 0
this 0
is 0
not 0
Mcdonald 0
's 0
, 0
every 0
place 0
makes 0
things 0
differently 0
While 0
it 0
is 0
understandable 0
that 0
every 0
place 0
is 0
indeed 0
different 0
, 0
there 0
was 0
not 0
a 0
need 0
to 0
be 0
uncourteous 0
to 0
customers 0
and 0
downright 0
rude 0
. 0
The 0
service 0
was 0
poor 0
, 0
restaurant 0
poorly 0
lit 0
, 0
staff 0
not 0
very 0
attentive 0
and 0
I 0
would 0
have 0
rather 0
eaten 0
at 0
a 0
Mcdonald 0
's 0
than 0
this 0
joint 0
. 0
I 0
absolutely 0
Loved 0
this 0
place 1
. 0
My 0
friends 0
spoke 0
so 0
much 0
about 0
it 0
for 0
months 0

made 0
the 0

We 0

i 0
went 0
to 0
utsav 0
about 0
a 0
yr 0
ago 0
with 0
my 0
family 0
. 0
The 0
food 1
was 0
good 0
. 0
The 0
place 1
was 0
nice 0
and 0
calm 0
. 0
but 0
the 0
service 3
was 0
a 0
bit 0
slow 0
. 0
I 0
work 0
around 0
the 0
corner 0
and 0
tried 0
it 0
with 0
a 0
colleague 0
for 0
the 0
first 0
time 0
. 0
The 0
buffet 1
had 0
a 0

and 0
we 0
had 0
several 0
other 0
nice 0
pastries 1

I 0
would 0
recommend 0
Roxy 0
's 0
for 0
that 0
, 0
but 0
not 0
for 0
their 0
food 3
. 0
My 0
son 0
and 0
his 0
girlfriend 0
both 0
wanted 0
cheeseburgers 2
and 0
they 0
were 0
huge 0
! 0
But 0
, 0
they 0
were 0
too 0
big 0
for 0
the 0
bun 0
. 0
Consequently 0
, 0
their 0
burgers 3
fell 0
apart 0
in 0
their 0
hands 0
and 0
made 0
such 0
a 0
mess 0
that 0
they 0
did'nt 0
feel 0
like 0
finishing 0
them 0
. 0
Also 0
they 0
were 0
$ 0
15 0
each 0
! 0
I 0
had 0
a 0
huge 0
pastrami 2
sandwich 2
on 2
a 2
roll 2
. 0
It 0
was 0
$ 0
14 0
not 0
really 0
bad 0
for 0
a 0
pound 0
of 0
Pastramibut 0
it 0
did 0
n't 0
have 0
much 0
tasteI 0
've 0
had 0
better 0
for 0
less 0
elsewhere 0
! 0
The 0
last 0
two 0
times 0
I 0
ordered 0
from 0
here 0
my 0
food 3
was 0
soo 0
spicy 0
that 0
I 0
could 0
barely 0
eat 0
it 0
, 0
and 0
the 0
spice 3
took 0
away 0
from 0
the 0
flavor 0
of 0
the 0
